Use the instructions below to enable [LiveIntent](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/ai-bots-automation-liveintent-overview.html) for your intents in Intent Builder.

When you enter Intent Builder, you will notice a column that tells you if a domain "Has LiveIntent" or not.

{: .note}
It is a best practice to only have one domain enabled for LiveIntent at a time. This is to minimize intent overlap.

Click on a domain of your choice. On the left side of the screen, you will see your list of intents. If an intent is enabled for LiveIntent, it will have a green dot to its left.

Under the Intents left-side dropdown, select "Enable LiveIntent" and select the intents in bulk.

{: .note}
It is a best practice to enable all intents within a domain for the best analysis.

You can view the enabled intents in the [LiveIntent dashboard](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/ai-bots-automation-liveintent-dashboard.html).
