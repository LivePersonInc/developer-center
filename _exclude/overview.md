### Overview

Intent Analyzer is LivePerson's hub for tracking and maintaining intents in real time. It provides enhanced reporting and analytics for your bots and automation.

You can leverage the consistent flow of data from Intent Analyzer to:

* Power next-generation analytics
* Orchestrate conversations with [Conversation Orchestrator](maven-ai-overview.html)
* Build effective bots with [Conversation Builder](conversation-builder-bot-workspace.html)

Intent Analyzer integrates seamlessly with [Intent Builder](intent-builder-overview.html) to provide a powerful, unified system for intent modeling and management.

### Get started

Before you begin, see [here](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/ai-bots-automation-intent-analyzer-the-power-of-an-intent-driven-contact-center.html) for information on the benefits of an intent-driven contact center, the benefits of being an intent-centric management solution (ICMS), and common use cases.

**To get started**, see [here](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/ai-bots-automation-intent-analyzer-overview.html#getting-started) for important information on enabling Intent Analyzer, getting permissions, and beginning with starter packs versus manual setup.

### Enable Intent Analyzer for intents

{: .important}
It's a best practice to have only one domain enabled for Intent Analyzer at a time; this minimizes intent overlap. Also, for the best analysis, it's a best practice to enable Intent Analyzer for all intents within a domain.

**To enable Intent Analyzer for intents**

1. Open Intent Builder, as described [here](intent-builder-overview.html#access-intent-builder).
2. In the dashboard that lists all domains, select the domain.
3. In the list of intents in the left panel, click the <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_enableIntentAnalyzer.png" alt="" > (Enable Intent Analyzer) icon.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/intentAnalyzer_enable.png" alt="" >

4. In the Enable Intent Analyzer dialog box, select the intents, and click **Save**.

    In the list of intents in the left panel, the intents for which Intent Analyzer is enabled now have a green dot beside them.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:250px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/intentAnalyzer_enabledIntents.png" alt="" >

    And in the dashboard that lists your domains, the domain now indicates that Intent Analyzer is enabled.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/intentAnalyzer_intentsDashboard.png" alt="" >

    You can view the enabled intents in the [Intent Analyzer dashboard](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/ai-bots-automation-intent-analyzer-dashboard.html).
