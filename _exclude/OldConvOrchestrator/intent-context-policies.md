### What is a Policy

A policy in Conversation Orchestrator is comprised of a *condition*, *action*, and *exception*, represented as a JSON block.

To create a policy, start with the **consumer journey you want to achieve**. For example, you may want to achieve the following outcome: “Route a group of intents (e.g. order inquiry, cancellation, scheduling) to a general order skill, unless customer is a VIP, then send them to their dedicated advisor.”

Next, **identify which attributes you may need to build this policy**. For example, you may need Intents, whether the customer is a VIP, and the customers' dedicated advisors. These attributes can be created, accessed, or managed in the Conversation Orchestrator [Conversation Context Service](maven-context-warehouse-overview.html).

#### Conditions

Conditions can be applied to each Attribute in Conversation Context Service. A condition block may have multiple conditions. They are represented in JSON as follows.

**Example 1**: Use a list to check if an email address is in that list.

{% raw %}
```json
"conditions": [
    {
      "property": "customerinfo.email",
      "type": "IS_IN",
      "value": "{{custom.vipList}}"
    }
]
```
{% endraw %}

**Example 2**: Check if customer is returning within 24 hours.

```json
"conditions": [
    {
      "property": "conversation.minutesSincePreviousMessage",
      "type": "LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL",
      "value": 1440
    }
]
```
Conditions can compare both named attributes as well as constant values:
1. **Attributes**: Attributes can be used with their qualified names, for example **custom.vipList** above
2. **Constants**: use the value directly with a number or string, for example time in minutes **1440** in above

Conversation Orchestrator will support the following conditional operators:

* `EQUAL`
* `NOT_EQUAL`
* `LESS_THAN`
* `LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL`
* `GREATER_THAN`
* `GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL`
* `CONTAINS`
* `IS_IN`

#### Actions

Actions define what to do next if the conditions are valid. An action block may have multiple actions. They are represented in JSON as follows.

**Example**: Route a conversation to a specific VIP skill.

{% raw %}
```json
"actions": [
    {
      "type": "TRANSFER_TO_SKILL",
      "payload": {
        "skillId": "{{custom.vipSkill}}"
      }
    }
]
```
{% endraw %}

Similar to conditions an action such as transferring to a skill can use either a variable or a constant value.

##### Get SkillIds from Conversational Cloud

To route to skills, you will need the SkillIds used by Conversational Cloud. To retrieve all the skill IDs:

1. Login to Conversational Cloud and then go to Users tab and then Skills
2. Then click on Actions and then export all

    <img class="fancyimage" width="600" src="img/maven/Get SkillID from LiveEngage.png">

3. Save the zip file and then open Skills.csv
4. All Skill IDs with associated skill name should be in this file. Copy and paste the skill IDs into your policy to transfer to a skill.

The following list of actions will be supported:

* `TRANSFER_TO_SKILL`
* `TRANSFER_TO_AGENT`
* `SEND_MESSAGE`

#### Exceptions

Exceptions define conditions and actions when unusual situations may occur. For example, an outage. Exception block takes precedence over the conditions/actions block at the root level. Exceptions are also provided as condition-action blocks.

**Example**: Send a VIP customer to a specific skill

```json
"exception": {
  "conditions": [
    {
      "property": "custom.vipList",
      "type": "EQUAL",
      "value": "True"
    }
  ],
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "TRANSFER_TO_SKILL",
      "payload": {
        "skillId": "<vipSkill>"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Create and Manage Policies

<img class="fancyimage" width="750" src="img/maven/intent-context-policies.png">

#### Create a new policy

1. Log in to Conversation Orchestrator and navigate to **Dynamic Routing/Intent & Context Policies**

2. Click on the button "New"

3. Edit the policy in JSON format using the inline text editor in the experience. You may also use your preferred JSON editor and then copy and paste the JSON.

4. Click Save button to save the new policy configuration

#### Enable or disable a policy

1. Each policy can be enabled or disabled. A policy will not be executed by Conversation Orchestrator if it is disabled.

2. Only policies that are enabled are evaluated by Conversation Orchestrator to make a routing decision

3. Use the on/off toggle switch to enable or disable a policy

#### Set the policy order

Conversation Orchestrator evaluates policies in the order they are created and shown in the user experience. Conversation Orchestrator will execute the first policy that satisfies all the conditions. To change the order of a policy

1. Select the policy

2. And then click the **Up** or **Down** buttons to move the policy in the list

### Using Policies in Conversations

Once you have created some policies there are two ways of using the policies to route conversations:
1. [Setup Conversation Orchestrator in LivePerson](maven-ai-powered-routing-set-up-maven-in-liveperson.html) to send your conversations to the Conversation Orchestrator bot. The Conversation Orchestrator bot will evaluate all the policies and then route them to the optimal agent, skill, or bot
2. [Use Conversation Orchestrator with your bot](maven-ai-powered-routing-use-maven-with-your-bot.html) using the Next Actions API and Conversation Context Service APIs. Your bot will handle branded greetings, intents, and other other attributes and then use Next Actions API to get the policy decision.
