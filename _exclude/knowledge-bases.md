**This tutorial is currently unavailable. Thanks for your patience as we work to update it to reflect the latest release of Conversation Builder.**

Brands often have static content, such as frequently asked questions, that can be addressed through bots and delivered with Conversation Builder. As opposed to creating new dialogs and specific interactions to handle these use cases, the Conversational Cloud provides Knowledge Base support to provide a seamless experience in delivering this content. A common design pattern at LivePerson is to include this Knowledge Base access in the Fallback Dialog, as a last check before triggering the Fallback interaction. In this section, you create a new knowledge base, which will be accessed in the Fallback dialog located in your Greeter Bot.

### Step 8: Create the FAQ knowledge base

In this step, you create a new FAQ knowledge base and add FAQ articles to it.

1. From the **Conversational AI** section of the Conversational Cloud, navigate to the **Knowledge Base** section.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:300px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/advtutorial/kb_app_option.png" alt="">

2. Click **Add Knowledge Base** in the upper-right corner.
3. On the **AI Enabled** tab of the window that appears, select **Internal Knowledge Base**.
4. Give the knowledge base the name **Getting Started KB**, and set the language to **English**. Here, you have the option of uploading a CSV or Google Sheet of your Knowledge Base articles. Leave the Upload field blank as you will create articles from scratch.

    Under **Intent Association**, select **Domain Intents** and create a new NLU V1 domain called **Retail FAQ**.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/advtutorial/kb_add_int_2.png" alt=""> 

    Click **Save** in the lower-right corner.

5. The next step is to add FAQ articles that are triggered by intents in your newly created **Retail FAQ** domain. Create the first article by selecting **Add New** in the upper-right corner. Give the article the title, *“What is your return policy?”* Using the **Select Intent** dropdown, create a new intent with the following details:

    * **Intent name**: Return policy
    * **Training Phrases**:
        * What is your return policy
        * How do I return something
        * How do I make a return
        * What is your policy for making returns

    After creating your new intent, finish the article by adding the following summary and clicking **Save**:

    *Complimentary Returns on U.S. orders:*

    *You have up to 30 days from the date you received your order to make a return.*

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/advtutorial/kb_add_article.png" alt="">

    {: .important}
    For the purpose of this demonstration, intents and training phrases are intentionally being kept simplistic to quickly showcase the capabilities of Domain Intents. A benefit of using Domain Intents is that, after creation, you can modify/improve the intents and training phrases using Intent Builder.

6. Back in our Getting Started KB page, repeat this process to add additional articles with the following information:

    * **Article Title**: How much is shipping?
    * **Intent**:
        * **Intent name**: Shipping costs
        * **Training Phrases**:
            * How much is shipping
            * What will shipping cost
            * Do you offer free shipping
    * **Summary**: *We offer free ground shipping on all orders within the United States. Please allow 3-5 business days for all ground orders.*

    * **Article Title**: How do I cancel an order?
    * **Intent**:
        * **Intent name**: Cancel order
        * **Training Phrases**:
            * How do I cancel an order
            * What if I have to cancel my order
            * I need to cancel my order
    * **Summary**: *Orders can be cancelled up to an hour after they are placed. Please contact our support team at atyourservice@retail.com for further assistance.*

    Additional details and tags can be included when creating your Knowledge Base articles. Please see the [developers' documentation on knowledge bases](knowledge-base-overview.html) for more details on how to use these features to optimize your Knowledge Base searches.

	Click **Save** in the lower-right corner.

7. Back in the **Getting Started KB** menu, confirm that the newly created articles are present in your list of articles. Note the **Inactive** designation, as all newly created articles need to be enabled prior to being accessible.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/advtutorial/kb_articles.png" alt="">

    For each article, click the article title, scroll down to the **Enable Article** setting, and turn it on. Click **Save**.

The knowledge base has now been created. Navigating back to Conversation Builder, next you provide an integration to access and display this content.

### Step 9: Create the Knowledge Base integration in the Fallback Dialog

Prior to displaying the Fallback message for unrecognized utterances, create a Knowledge Base integration to check if the user’s intent can be satisfied with an FAQ article as a last resort.

1. From the **Conversational AI** section of the Conversational Cloud, navigate to **Conversation Builder**, and select the Greeter Bot.
2. Click **Integrations** in the menu in the upper-left corner, then click **Add Integration** in the upper-right corner. In the **Add Integration** form, specify the following:

    * **Integration Name**: FAQ
    * **Response Data Variable Name**: FAQ
    * **Integration Type**: Knowledge Base
    * **Knowledge Base**: Getting Started KB

    The remainder of the form should have been auto completed when the Knowledge Base integration type was selected. Ensure that the form matches the content in the screenshot.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/advtutorial/kb_integration_add.png" alt="">

3. Click **Save** in the lower right hand corner, and on success, navigate to the Fallback dialog.
4. In the Fallback, create a new **Integration** interaction, and drag and drop the interaction above the **fallback_starter** interaction. From the **Select integration** dropdown, select the newly created FAQ integration. 

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:700px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/advtutorial/kb_integration_fallback_1.png" alt="">

    Rules will need to be created to direct the flow of the conversation based on whether there was a successful Knowledge Base query. Prior to doing so, create a new text message interaction that will display a successful search article.

5. Create a new **Text message** interaction, and nest it between the integration and the fallback_starter.

    For the text content, type `{FAQ.article}`. For the **Next Action**, select **End Interaction** to prevent triggering the fallback_starter after display.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:700px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/advtutorial/kb_integration_fallback_2.png" alt="">

6. Create custom rules to account for successful and unsuccessful FAQ search requests. In the integration, in the **Next Action** dropdown, click **+ Custom Rule**, and complete with the following:
    * Rule name: KB Success
    * **+ Add Condition**: **API Result** matches **Success**
    * **And Go To**: Go To: Next Interaction
	
	Click **Save**.

7. Create a second rule to account for a failed search; this will point to the **fallback_starter** as the next action. Click **+ Custom Rule**, and complete with the following:
    * **Rule name**: KB Failure
    * **+ Add Condition**: **API Result** matches **Failure**
    * **And Go To**: Go To: fallback_starter

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:700px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/advtutorial/kb_integration_fallback_3.png" alt="">

8. Test the FAQ search. Open the previewer, reset the session, and test user utterances that trigger the FAQ articles. Also test utterances you intend to pass through to the fallback_starter.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:350px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/advtutorial/kb_integration_preview.png" alt="">

    Knowledge bases are optimized to handle frequently asked questions and other static content that you want to provide for users. By including them intelligently in your conversation designs, you can round out the bot experience to answer questions and ensure users will be happy to return to your bot.
