### Introduction

<div class="important">The intended audience of this document is LivePerson Professional Services and other account stakeholders. It is to be used for consulting 3rd party bot builders in integrating their bots to LivePerson on behalf of our customers.</div>

The LiveEngage platform helps orchestrate the flow of messages back and forth between consumers and Agents. Consumers can be on any end-user channel such as SMS, Web, Facebook Messenger and Apple Messages for Business, and communicate with both Human and Automated (Bot) agents. A bot is an automated conversational agent that performs a specific goal. LiveEngage has several avenues through which our customers can develop and deploy bots:

* BotCentral Platform (Owned by Liveperson, soon to be deprecated by the Conversation Builder)

* Conversation Builder, a LivePerson product (in Beta), which allows customers to build and deploy bots directly within LiveEngage (Support for this channel is coming soon).

* Enterprise customers can build and deploy bots using different frameworks and products and then enable them through LiveEngage. Some of these products include IBM Watson, Microsoft Bot framework, Google Dialogflow, Amazon Lex or any other niche bot platforms customers want to use to build bots.

This guide helps you with steps required to deploy bots developed via such third party platforms on the LiveEngage platform. Deploying bots in LiveEngage enables all the messages to go through LiveEngage Hub, routing them to the bots based on the skills assigned to them.

### Use Cases

1. IBM Watson (Watson Assistant)

    {% raw %}
    `https://external.botcentralapi.com/connector/{{consumerId}}`
    {% endraw %}



### Custom Connectors

Customers can always write their own custom Bot connector using our Messaging Agent SDK and Chat Agent API.  This is mainly for the small, medium niche platforms who want to build connectivity to LiveEngage.

1. Chat Bots

### FAQS

**What should we do if our Infrastructure team does not allow Websocket based integrations into LiveEngage?**

Connectors deployed using BotCentral platform are Http Proxy connectors, which can be used in this case.

**How do I get started?**

Contact your client partner and they will initiate the process with the Technical Services team.
