SNIPPET FOR TOP SECTION

- **Consumer Authentication**: Use this when you require the bot to make API calls on behalf of the consumer. With this type of credential, the consumer is sent an authentication link, uses it to authenticate, and obtains a token that is sent to the bot. This “delegates” access to the bot, so it can make the API calls.

### Add a Consumer Authentication credential

You can create a Consumer Authentication credential and use it in [API integrations](conversation-builder-integrations-api-integrations.html) when you require the bot to make API calls on behalf of the consumer. With this credential, the consumer receives an authentication link, uses it to authenticate, and obtains a token that is sent to the bot. This “delegates” access to the bot, so it can make the API calls. The general flow is this:

1. In the bot, the Integration interaction is triggered in the dialog.
2. The bot sends an authentication URL (a plain link) to the consumer.

3. The consumer clicks the link, is directed to the authentication URL (e.g., a login page), and authenticates, thereby obtaining a token.
4. The token is sent to the bot.
5. The bot runs the integration (with the token) and responds with a result.

5. Click **Next**.
6. In the Add Credentials dialog box, specify the following:
