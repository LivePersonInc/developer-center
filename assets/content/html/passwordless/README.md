* Login with a **magic link** via **email** using **Lock**
* Login with a **one time code** via **sms** using your **own UI**

You can read more about Passwordless Authentication on our [Doc's Site](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/passwordless), where you will find the complete Single Page App tutorials for:

* [Authenticate users with a one time code via SMS](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/passwordless/spa-sms)
* [Authenticate users with a one time code via Email](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/passwordless/spa-email-code)
* [Authenticate users with a magic link via Email](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/passwordless/spa-email-link)

## Install locally

1. Create an auth0-variables.js file with your Auth0 credentials. You can use auth0-variables.sample.js as a template. You can get the clientId and domain from the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com).
2. In your App's configuration on the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com), add `http://localhost:3000` to the **Allowed Origins (CORS)** list in order for the one time code samples to work, and add `http://localhost:3000/custom-magic-link.html, http://localhost:3000/lock-magic-link.html` to the **Allowed Callback URLs** list for the magic link samples to function.
3. Initialize a web server in the samples folder. You can do it for instance with `serve`:
	* Install node
	* run `npm install -g serve`
	* run `serve` in the project's folder to start a server
4. Go to the [index page](http://localhost:3000) and select the scenario you want to try.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
