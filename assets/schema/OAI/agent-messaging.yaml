    3. The agent subscribes to get his list of existing assigned conversations (``subscribeExConversations``).
    3. The agent sets his availablity to online (``setAgentState``)
    4. The agent gets a ring notifying on a new conversation task. (``routingTaskNotification``)
    5. The agent send his acceptance to get the task (``updateRoutingTask``).
    6. The agent get a notification on the new conversation added to his list of assigned conversations. (``ExConversationNotification``)
    7. The agent subscribes to get the content of this conversation. (``subscribeMessagingEvents``)
    8. The agent gets existing content events, and possibly other realtime notification about messages 
    events that are being published to the conversation. (``messagingEventNotification``)
    9. The agent publish his own text messages, recipt events and presence events to the conversations. (``publishEvent``)
