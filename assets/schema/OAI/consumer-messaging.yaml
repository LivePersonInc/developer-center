    # Introduction
    
    In this document document you will find the reference to the api methods.
    In order to invoke those methods you will first have to:
        
        * Establish a websocket connection to the messaging service.
        * Send authentication token, either by attaching it to the websocket connection request header,
        or sending InitConnection request after the connection has been established.
    
    Please refer to the [Getting Started](https://developers.liveperson.com/consumer-int-getting-started.html) section to see how to do that.
        
    ## Requests
    
    Inovking the api methods is done by sending json messages on the open websocket connection. The messages should be in
    the following format:
        
    ```json
    {
        "type" : "cm.AgentRequestConversation",
        "id" : "hsjshka8162s",
        "body" : { "ttrDefName" : "NORMAL" }
    }
    ```
    
    In the following reference, you will find the ``type``, and the ``body`` of each supported request.
    The ``id`` should be unique string. It will be attached to the service response for correlation purposes.
    
    ## Responses

    Each request will responded by the service with a response message in the following format:
        
    ```json
    {
            "kind" : "resp",
            "reqId" : "hsjshka8162s",
            "type" : "cm.MyRequestResponse",
            "code" : 200,
            "body" : { "conversationId" : "hdjsdhksh2" }
    }
    ```
    
    The possible ``code`` and the ``body`` are documented on each request.
    
    ## Notifications
    
    Some of the requests creates subscription in the server. Following that the server will send notifications
    treggered by specific events. The notification messages will be structured in the following format:
        
    ```json
    {
            "kind" : "notification",
            "type" : "ms.MessagingEventNotification",
            "body" : { "conversationId" : "hdjsdhksh2" }
    }
    ```
    
    The specific ``type`` and ``body`` structure for each notfication, will be documented as reponse code ``100``
    for the subscription request.
