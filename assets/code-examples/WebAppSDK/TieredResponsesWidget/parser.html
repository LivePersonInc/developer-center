    The following are instructions to using this parser:

    -Export predefined content from Legacy for each category
    -Combine the excel files into one.
    -If each category has a different max-depth, create "Title" columns for the absolute maximum depth and left-align the information such that the list builds out from left to right.
    -Expandable menus (categories and subcategories) should be denoted with an X in the first column of the excel file.
    -Main categories should be on column 2 on a line of its own
    -Subcategories be in the column of its respective level on a line of its own.
    -Response titles should be on the same line as the response text itself
    -All responses should be in the same column titled "Response Text"

    For example:

    Is menus    Title       Title           Title           Title           Title               Response Text
    X           Category
    X                       Subcategory
                                            Response-Title                                      Response
    X                       Subcategory
    X                                       Subcategory
    X                                                       Subcategory
                                                                            Response-Title      Response
    X           Category
                            Response-Title                                                      Response
    X           Category
    X                       Subcategory
    X                                       Subcategory
                                                            Response-Title                      Response
