# SC - Knowledge Base Widget 
This is an example widget that was created for the SC team that shows how you can have a knowledge base of information that an agent can search through, and then send that content to a visitor. 

This widget uses the CollapsibleLists JS library.

### Contribution 
Thank you Anthony Kunjbehari for providing the examples for this widget.

## Background
This widget was built for the SC team to use. The example widget was built off of the original knowledge base widget, but it was more specific use cases. 

One of the challenges that came up was when you are sending articles with images, you will need to add extra styling to the image to have it show up properly in the chat window.

## Other Use Cases
This widget could easily be modified to pull the content from some type of database, or to allow agents add new content on the fly. It could also be used for a starting point of having automatic articles display based on visitor information, or chat lines.
