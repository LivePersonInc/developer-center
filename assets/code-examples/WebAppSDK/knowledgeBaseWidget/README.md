# Knowledge Base Widget
This is an example widget that shows how you can have a knowledge base of information that an agent can search through, and then send that content to a visitor. 

This widget uses the CollapsibleLists JS library.

## Background
This widget was built as a proof of concept for a client that required that their canned responses keep the same folder strucure they had in legacy. Currently in LiveEngage, the pre-defined content does not allow for sub folders to be created, and you are limited to 100 main categories.

One of the challenges that came up was when you are sending articles with images, you will need to add extra styling to the image to have it show up properly in the chat window.

## Other Use Cases
This widget could easily be modified to pull the content from some type of database, or to allow agents add new content on the fly. It could also be used for a starting point of having automatic articles display based on visitor information, or chat lines.
