# Alias Widget
This is an example widget of how you can get all of the information on the Engagement Attributes and display them. The widget has an example of how you can give an engagement attribute an alias by pulling that variable and then displaying it with a different name.

The widget is built using Bootstrap, JQuery, and the Web App SDK.

## Background
This widget was built as a proof of concept for a client that needed to pass a bunch of custom variables that did not fit into any of the engagement attributes that are current available, and they wanted the ability to display the correct name for that variable. The widget basically takes all of the engagement attributes that are passed, and displays them in the widget. 

To modify the widget, you would just need to update the display name for what you want the engagement attribute to display as. The code is also divided up into sections, so you can easily remove any of the engagement attributes that you will not be using.

## Other Use Cases
This widget could be used as a starting point for sending engagement attributes to a server, or another system.
