# SDK Sample Widget
This is an example widget that shows how you can write chat lines to the agent console, get information from the agent console, and how you can bind data from the agent console.

This widget was built using Angular.

## Background
This widget was built as a proof to show the functionality that is available with the Web App SDK. This widget was originally built by someone at LivePerson. I am sharing the source code here since it is no longer available through the original link.

## Other Use Cases
This widget is a good starting point for other widgets since it has all the base functionality.
