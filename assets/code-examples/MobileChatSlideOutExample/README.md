# Mobile Chat Slide Out Example
This is an example of how you can setup a mobile slide out menu that will have the following:
* A link to chat
* A link to send a text message (using default messaging app on your phone)
* A link to send an email (using the default email app on your phone)
* A link to call a phone number

The slideout is built using Bootstrap, JQuery, and Fancybox.
