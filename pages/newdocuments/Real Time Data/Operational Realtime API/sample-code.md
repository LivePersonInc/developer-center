This is a sample application written in Spring, Maven, Java, and HTML, that demonstrates how to call the LiveEngage Operational Real-Time API.

OAuth is a server-to-server authentication method, but the example also includes a basic client to server implementation. This is attached in a zip file.

The core implementation of OAuth is implemented in OAuthUtil.java. This is attached separately but also part of the zip file.
