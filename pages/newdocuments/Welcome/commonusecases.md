Below you'll find a full description of each section of the documentation. This overview will help you better understand what our documentation and APIs can help you do on top of the LiveEngage Open Platform. However, if you already have a project in mind and would simply like to start building, we've included a list of common use cases and documents that are a good entry point to start from. If you can't find the project you had in mind, please read the full description of the different sections below or reach out to Dev Support for more guidance!

* **Integrating LiveEngage with your Native App** - simply refer to our Mobile App Messaging SDKs, [for iOS](consumer-experience-ios-sdk-overview.html) or [for Android](android-overview.html). These include everything you need to know in order to integrate LiveEngage with mobile applications.

* **Customizing LiveEngage Reporting or Creating New Reports** - this use case would involve working with our Data APIs, specifically our [Data Access API](data-data-access-overview.html). It would also require developing some sort of UI if you'd like to display these reports. For more information, you can also refer to our [Custom Dashboard solution document](products-data-custom-dashboard-overview.html).

* **Building or Integrating a New Workspace Widget** - LiveEngage gives you the ability to add third party service widgets into the agent workspace for quick reference. For example, you could add your CRM to the agent workspace, allowing your agents to submit or update leads right from LiveEngage. To achieve this, please refer to the [Agent Workspace Widget SDK](agent-workspace-sdk-overview.html).

* **Looking for more use cases?** Check out the Major Flows document, a part of this Getting Started guide, for more detailed  examples of how to use our APIs to build on top of our Open Platform.
