All public properties and methods can be found in the namespace lpTag.agentSDK.

*Note: The project is called the client-SDK as it is the client-side of our SDK. However, since you use it to communicate with the agent, the code you write acknowledges the fact that you are communicating with the Agent Workspace.*
