This document outlines all the events published on the brand’s page by the LiveEngage Tag. These events provide customers transparency into the engagement and engagement window display flow, as well as a way to customize and act upon the obtained data. For example, a brand can hide an embedded div content only if the embedded engagement is displayed.
