### Introduction

The LiveEngage Messaging Window API includes a file sharing feature. This feature enables consumers to share files with agents, such as images. File Sharing can also be enabled by using the Connector API, for cases when images are sent through third party applications. Please refer to the [Connector API documentation](share-image-example.html) for more information on how to do this.

A typical flow of setting up the file sharing feature using the Messaging Window API:

1. [Enable file sharing capability](rich-messaging-file-sharing-1.html)

2. [Create a conversation](rich-messaging-file-sharing-2.html)

3. [Request an upload URL](rich-messaging-file-sharing-3.html)

4. [Upload the file to storage](rich-messaging-file-sharing-4.html)

5. [Publish the file as a message inside the conversation](rich-messaging-file-sharing-5.html)

6. [Request a download URL](rich-messaging-file-sharing-6.html)

7. [Download file from storage](rich-messaging-file-sharing-7.html)

We will examine and explain each stage in detail as part of this documentation.

**Note:** If you would like to follow the steps using `bash`, please see the [Prerequisites document](consumer-int-get-msg.html#prerequisites).
