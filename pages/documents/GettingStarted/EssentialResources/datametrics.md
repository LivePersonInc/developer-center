LiveEngage uses a large amount of metrics to provide insightful and detailed reporting.

The Report Builder offers brands ready-made dashboards reflecting historic data drawn from their LiveEngage account activity. These dashboards allow brands to monitor and optimize contact center operations, increase conversions through LiveEngage campaigns and enact data-driven decisions. All the data metrics available in the Report Builder, with their definition and location within the different dashboards can be found in our [Knowledge Center](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/data-reporting-reporting-metrics.html).
