LivePerson's **Voice & Video SDK** allows you to communicate with your customers in realtime through your brand's app. The SDK enriches your app with realtime voice & video calling capabilities, built atop of our highly scalable **Messaging SDK** solution.

Your agents engage from a web browser using our LiveEngage platform, while your consumers will be using your brand's own app, obtained fom the AppStore.

In addition to voice & video calls, the SDK supports realtime screen-sharing and in-app remote control, referred to as _In-app CoBrowsing_. This means that you can control your mobile app from any supported browser. This allows you to give visual guidance and helps you resolve difficult issues more quickly.

Currently we support inbound calls only (that is, an agent calls a consumer).
