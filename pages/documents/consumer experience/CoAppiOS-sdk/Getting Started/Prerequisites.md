LivePerson Voice & Video is an SDK (_Source Development Kit_) for the **Apple iOS** platform. In order to integrate with us, you need to have an app of your own to which you have full source code access. Basic programming knowledge is required.


### Dependencies
The SDK requires our LivePerson **Messaging SDK** integrated into your app. Your consumers will always engage in a messaging conversation first, before your agents choose to escalate the conversation to a *Voice*, *Video* or *CoBrowse* session.

### Supported iOS Versions

| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------|

| 9.0 + | supported, with limitations | limited call notifications  |

### Supported Devices

  * All **iPhone models starting from iPhone 5s**
  * iPhone 4s/5 are not officially supported, but may work
  * iPads are currently not officially supported, but may work
  * iPods are not supported

### Supported Programming Languages
Only **native applications** written in the either or both programming languages:
  * **Swift**
  * **Objective-C**

Cross-platform apps using native wrappers (e.g. Cordova) can be made to integrate with voice & video support with some additional setup effort. Remote-app control however is only possible on native UI components (like those generated by _React Native_ or _Titanium_). **Neither are currently officially supported.**
