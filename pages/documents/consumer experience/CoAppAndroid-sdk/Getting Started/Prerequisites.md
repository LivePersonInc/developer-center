LivePerson Voice & Video is an SDK (_Source Development Kit_) for the **Google Android** platform. In order to integrate with us, you need to have an app of your own to which you have full source code access. Basic programming knowledge is required.

### Dependencies

The SDK requires our LivePerson [**Messaging SDK**](android-overview.html){:target="_blank"} integrated into your app. Your consumers will always engage in a messaging conversation first, before your agents choose to escalate the conversation to a *Voice*, *Video* or *CoBrowse* session.

Please make sure your app meets the following minimal requirements:

- Minimal supported API level is 21 (Lollipop, Android 5.0)
- Recommended minimal API level is 23 (Marshmallow, Android 6.0)
- In-app CoBrwosing is only supported in API levels >= 21 (Lollipop) due to [MediaProjection API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/projection/MediaProjection.html)

### Supported Android Versions

| Android API level | Support |  Limitations |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------|
| 20 or less | not supported  | - |
| 21 + | supported | fully supported |

### Supported Devices

In general, all Android phones starting from API level 21 are supported. However, due to vendor-specific customizations to the Android OS, we provide certified support for selected devices. Please see the support chart (last revision: May 2017) below:

### Supported Programming Languages

Only **native applications** written in **Java** are currently supported.

**Note:** Cross-platform apps using native wrappers (e.g. Cordova) can be made to integrate with voice & video support with some additional setup effort. Remote-app control however is only possible on native UI components (like generated by _React Native_ or _Titanium_). **Neither are currently officially supported.**
