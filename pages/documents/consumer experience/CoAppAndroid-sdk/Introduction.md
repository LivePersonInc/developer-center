LivePerson's **Voice & Video SDK** allows you to communicate with your customers in realtime through your brand's app. The SDK enriches your app with realtime voice & video calling capabilities, built atop of our highly scalable **Messaging SDK** solution.

Your agents engage from a web browser using our LiveEngage platform, while your consumers will be using your brand's own app, obtained from the PlayStore.

In addition to voice & video calls the SDK supports realtime screen-sharing and in-app remote control, referred to as _In-app CoBrowsing_. This means that you can remotely control your mobile app from any supported browser (see [Prerequisites](consumer-experience-voice-video-android-prerequisites.html)). This allows you to give visual guidance and helps you resolve difficult issues more quickly.

Currently we support inbound calls only (that is, an agent calls a consumer).
