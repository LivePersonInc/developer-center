* Each of these pre-bound events also have an event specific payload associated with it that the triggering system will provide. However, this will also be used during testing and visible during development in the "Payload" tab.

* Other systems might invoke functions based on events, not only function, e.g. LiveEngage services will invoke functions that have the Event: "Chat Post Survey E-Mail Transcript".
