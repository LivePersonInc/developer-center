### Android Messaging SDK -  version 2.5

These are the main feature releases available in the Mobile App Messaging SDK version 2.5 for Android.

Version 2.5 roll-out: July 2nd 2017

[Version Specific System Requirements Document](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ce-sr/CA/Admin/Sys+req/System+requirements+v5.8.pdf)


#### New functionalities

##### Custom fonts

In order for consumers to enjoy the full brand experience while messaging in-app, brands are able to configure certified operating system fonts to appear in the messaging window. The fonts can be used across all elements, or only for the font within the message bubble.

The SDK also supports the use of a brand’s own customized fonts (although these are not certified).

Custom fonts are not supported for Native iOS properties such as:
* Activity mode - Overflow menu
* Popup messages

##### New way to listen to LP events via local intents

A new method of listening to LP events has been added. This method allows the host app to register to receive a specific action or to receive all of them. All of the actions match and correspond to the existing callback method. LivePerson recommends using the SDK’s Broadcast Receiver to receive these intent actions, as this system allows the user to listen to specific actions, and is not reliant on the SDK’s life cycle.

Note: Brands can still choose to use the callback method, which remains valid and supported.
