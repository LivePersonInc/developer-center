### Android Messaging SDK -  Version 3.1

These are the main feature releases available in the **Mobile App Messaging SDK version 3.1 for Android**.

**Version 3.1 planned roll-out: March 18h 2018**

[Version Specific System Requirements Document](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ce-sr/CA/Admin/Sys+req/System+requirements+v6.4.pdf)

#### New functionalities

##### Campaigns for Messaging - Monitoring APIs

**Type:** Developer Experience Feature

**Available to all customers?** Yes.

The addition of campaigns for mobile app and web messaging will allow brands to manage their engagements easily and efficiently across these channels, targeting customers based on unauthenticated attributes or locations and routing them to a desired skill.

Being able to track customer activity in all areas of the brand app and provide information on these interactions to LiveEngage boosts agent efficiency and enables more accurate reporting.

Using the Monitoring APIs, brands can:

1. Report on the customer’s journey inside the app

2. Get engagements based on the reported SDEs

3. Route conversations to a specific skill (based on engagements)

##### Monitoring APIs

The below APIs enable brands to use Campaigns for Messaging inside the brand’s app

 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>getEngagement(Context context, @Nullable String consumerId, MonitoringParams monitoringParams, EngagementCallback callback)</td>

**Please note: while the APIs are already available in the SDK, the backend will be available in mid-April. Please consult your account team before using the APIs.**

##### Conversation History Control

**Type:** Developer Experience Feature

**Available to all customers?** Yes.

To enhance control of customer data retention, scalability and performance, and support the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), open conversations will be loaded from a real time service while closed conversations will be loaded from a history service.

The change will be **seamless** for brands who upgrade to SDK version 3.1. Brands choosing not to upgrade to SDK v3.1 will be able to view the conversation history from the last 14 days. The history stored on the consumer’s device will also be available.

The following additional conditions and configurations are required:*

<table>
<thead>
 <tr>
 <th>Backend update</th>
 <th>Backend enablement</th>
 <th>Backend configuration </th>
 <th>SDK enablement </th>
 <th>SDK configuration </th>

##### History and Active Conversation View

**Type:** Developer Experience Feature

**Available to all customers?** Yes.

New APIs will give brands control over the conversations presented in the conversation window. For example, brands can choose to present only the last 180 days of conversation history.

These APIs can be used together with getengagement (Monitoring APIs) to decide how to present  conversations history according to whether there is an open conversation or not. For example, if there is no open conversation, brands can present a ‘View conversation history’ button which will present only the closed conversations from the last 180 days.

The new APIs allows:

* Getting an indication if there is an open conversation or not (Monitoring APIs)

* Controlling which conversations will be presented by status (open\closed)

* Controlling the time frame of presented conversations (by days)

 * When using historyConversationsMaxDays, LPConversationHistoryMaxDaysDateType will decide if to filter by the conversations' start date or end date. When not providing a value, startConversationDate will be the default.
