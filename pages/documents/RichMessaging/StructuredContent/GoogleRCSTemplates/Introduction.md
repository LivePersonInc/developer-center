### Overview 

With Google RCS Business Messaging, brands can communicate with consumers through Android Messages, Google’s native messaging app. RCS Business Messaging has a range of rich media and rich messaging capabilities, providing an enhanced messaging experience.

The Google RCS messaging connector now provides Structured Content Templates that are rendered by Google. When agents or bots on LiveEngage share structured content templates, consumers will view the rendered templates via the Android Messages app.

See the [Structured Content Introduction](structured-content-introduction-to-structured-content.html) for more basic information about Structured Content templates and elements.
