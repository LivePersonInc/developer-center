Maven is LivePerson’s AI engine. It orchestrates every consumer conversation with a brand to a mutually valuable outcome.

Maven will:

- assess the intent and context

- suggest optimized next conversational action; including asking clarifying questions, suggesting knowledge base answers, engaging virtual assistants, routing to a particular agent, and more

- test, accept feedback and measure every decision; accelerating customer experience improvements and brand efficiency

Maven includes out-of-the-box experiences that do not require code via the Maven Hub, but it also allows developers to interact with its AI engine via APIs.
