Maven introduces a self-service, low-code/no-code experience for brands to enable or tune Maven capabilities and features. With Maven brands can:

1. Setup **Maven Assist** recommended actions to increase agent productivity by suggesting bots or knowledgebase articles based on customer’s intents

2. Manage and use the **Maven Context warehouse**, a repository for brand, session, or customer attributes, including ability to connect to external datasources (CRM using a [LivePerson Function](liveperson-functions-overview.html)), and use these attributes throughout the customer’s conversation journey or in routing policies

3. Author dynamic routing policies based on attributes (intent, content, session) to route to the right human or bot - unlocking highly personalized consumer journeys.

4. Access developer features such as AskMaven for next action or Context Services APIs for the context warehouse to customize and integrate Maven AI orchestration into their decision processes
