Now that you have created some Intent and Context based policies, you want to use them in your conversation pipelines. There are primarily two ways of onboarding and using the policies. 

### Add "Maven" Skill to your campaigns

In this case, you will be sending your conversations to a Maven. Maven will evaluate all the policies and then execute those policies (e.g. transferring the conversation to a skill). This is appropriate if:

1. You are only routing based on Inbox and Custom (FaaS or Static) attributes

2. You don't have a concierge bot

3. You do not need high levels of customizations and therefore programmatic access to Maven capabilities

### Setup Live Engage

### Provide Bot User Credentials to Maven
