All Conversation Builder Automations are based upon **templates**. The Basic Automation Template is the best choice if you want to create a completely custom automation from scratch.

For other, more common use cases, Conversation Builder has a set of predefined, industry vertical templates that enable rapid adoption of automation.

Each conversational template consists of the following capabilities:

* Intents associated with the use case

* Conversational dialogs with appropriate interactions for the respective channels or end points (e.g. Web, Apple Business Chat, SMS etc.)

* API integrations with industry leading services (e.g. Shopify in Retail) as well as brand-specific services
