[Business Chat List Picker](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/businesschat/enhancing_the_customer_s_user_experience/sending_a_list_picker) enables human or automated agents to share a list of items and information about the items while allowing the consumer to select multiple items and reply back with the selection. The following capabilities are supported :

* Define items information - item name, description, image.
* Items sections - divide your list of items to section based on the product categories
* Multi-selection - Allow the consumer to select multiple items
* receivedMessage and replyMessage bubbles style structures - define the layouts for the bubbles that are received by the consumer on the Business Chat thread, and replied to.

Brands are able to share the List Picker interactive message through Rich Messaging elements while using Rich Messaging JSON properties to define the list layout structure while using metadata fields in order to define the received and reply bubble structures and multi-selection enablement.

Below is an image example of a Business Chat List Picker with multi-selection turned on:
