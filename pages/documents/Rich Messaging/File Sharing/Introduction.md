### Introduction

The LiveEngage Messaging Window API includes a file sharing feature. This feature enables consumers to share files with agents, such as images.

A typical flow of setting up the file sharing feature using the Messaging Window API:

1. [Enable file sharing capability](rich-messaging-file-sharing-1.html)

2. [Create a conversation](rich-messaging-file-sharing-2.html)

3. [Request an upload URL](rich-messaging-file-sharing-3.html)

4. [Upload the file to storage](rich-messaging-file-sharing-4.html)

5. [Publish the file as a message inside the conversation](rich-messaging-file-sharing-5.html)

6. [Request a download URL](rich-messaging-file-sharing-6.html)

7. [Download file from storage](rich-messaging-file-sharing-7.html)

We will examine and explain each stage in detail as part of this documentation.

**Note:** If you would like to follow the steps using bash, please see the (Prerequisites document)(consumer-int-get-msg.html#prerequisites).
