### Getting Started

To enable LiveIntent on your account, please contact your LivePerson account representative.

#### Permissions

LiveIntent inherits its permission structure from Conversation Builder, as the primary administration/configuration work is related to setting up intents and training models in [Intent Builder](intent-builder-overview.html). Therefore, LiveIntent also requires Conversation Builder permissions to be turned on in the LiveEngage Administrator Profile, if not already done so.

Access to the [LiveIntent dashboard](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/ai-bots-automation-liveintent-dashboard.html) is granted to users with the following permissions:

* BOT_BUILDER_ADMIN
* BOT_BUILDER_BOTS
* BOT_BUILDER_CONTENT_USER
* BOT_BUILDER_BUSINESS_USER
* LPA

#### Starter Pack Quick Start

If you don't already have intents created in Intent Builder, and you want to get up to speed quickly, LiveIntent offers starter packs filled with common intents for different business verticals. These starter packs leverage your historical transcript data to automatically create a model for your brand.

To get started with starter packs, please contact your LivePerson account representative.

#### Manual Setup

* If you already have intents in Intent Builder, see [here](liveintent-enabling-liveintent.html) for information on how to enable them in LiveIntent.

* If you don't have intents in Intent Builder, but you want to set them up manually, use [Intent Builder](intent-builder-overview.html) to create a domain and the intents, add training phrases, and [enable liveintent](liveintent-enabling-liveintent.html).

* If you have intents in an external system, you can import them into Intent Builder.

### Using LiveIntent

When you have intents, and they are enabled for LiveIntent, you can view the data in the [LiveIntent dashboard](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/ai-bots-automation-liveintent-dashboard.html).
