All Conversation Builder bots are based on **templates**.

The Custom Bot template is the best choice if you want to create a completely custom bot from scratch.

For other, more common use cases, Conversation Builder has a set of predefined, industry vertical templates that enable rapid adoption of automation.

Each conversational template consists of the following capabilities:

* Intents associated with the use case

* Conversational dialogs with appropriate interactions for the respective channels or end points (Web, Apple Business Chat, SMS, etc.)

* API integrations with industry-leading services (e.g., Shopify in Retail) and brand-specific services
