### iOS Messaging SDK - Version 3.2.2
iOS Messaging SDK v3.2.2 contains the following bug fixes:

#### Symptom:

When calling getEngagement while there is an active conversation which is not related to a campaign, the response returns an error.

#### Fix:

When calling getEngagement while there is an active conversation which is not related to a campaign, a response will be returned with the available information.

#### Symptom:

In some cases, the badge counter was returned with an incorrect value, which represents a previous value. For example, when an agent sent messages while the conversation screen was in the background.

#### Fix:

Badge counter is now showing the actual value.

#### Symptom:

In case of a failure in ‘logout’, the user’s data might be displayed with empty message bubbles the next time that the consumer opens the conversation screen.

#### Fix:

The user’s data is now cleared as expected only if the ‘logout’ succeeded.

#### Symptom:

In some cases, the badge counter was returned with an incorrect value, which represents a previous value.

#### Fix:

Badge counter is now showing the actual value regardless the state of the conversation.
