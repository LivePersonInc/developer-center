### iOS Messaging SDK - Version 3.1.4 (identical to 3.1.0.24)
Version 3.1.0.24 - Supports Xcode 9.2

Version 3.1.4 - Supports Xcode 9.3

#### Symptom:

In some cases where two consumers use the same device (one after the other), push notifications directed to the first consumer were routed to the device although a different consumer was using it.

#### Fix:

Before registering a new consumer for push notification, we make sure the previous consumer was unregistered.

#### Symptom:

In some cases, when using older iOS versions (~iOS 9) and older devices, and fetching additional history, the UI of the conversation screen breaks and from time to time, the app might crash as well.

#### Fix:

The UI will maintain its structure after fetching additional history and prevent a possible crash.


#### Symptom:

After a brand calls to Clear History, the conversation is removed from the UI but when the consumer navigates back to the screen the history is presented again.

#### Fix:

History will not be presented after calling Clear History.


#### Symptom:

In some cases, when the SDK is trying to connect to LivePerson’s servers, there is no indication for the consumer.

#### Fix:

An indication will be presented while the SDK attempts to connect to the server.
