**Release date:** July 25, 2019

### Overview
Android Mobile Messaging SDK version 4.1.0 primarily provides enhancements to SDK stability and Accessibility tools (TalkBack).

### Environmental Requirements
The Android Mobile Messaging SDK version 4.1.0 uses:
- Minimum API version 19
- Compile API version 28
- Target API version 28
- Maps SDK "com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:16.1.0"


### New Features:
- Added a callback parameter to the `unregisterLPPusher` API, similar to the one that exists for the `registerLPPusher` API.
- A backwards-compatible copy of `unregisterLPPusher` without the callback has also been added, and marked Deprecated, as the version with a callback is the preferred one for all uses. 

### Bugs fixed:
- Hyperlink color property `consumer_bubble_message_link_text_color` is now properly applied to both preview-able and non-preview-able links.
- Incoming messages are no longer marked as "read" when the user is looking at the History View instead of the active conversation.
- CSAT survey screen no longer loses the Agent's information when an Agent closes and immediately re-opens a conversation.
- Image resources `lp_messaging_ui_ic_agent_avatar` and `lp_messaging_ui_brand_logo` can now both be overridden with Vector Drawables in the `drawable` folder, where previously a workaround was required.
- Corrected several instances of String resources not respecting the SDK language settings, instead picking up the device language.
- Pressing the scroll-to-bottom button while in an Unauthenticated flow no longer occasionally crashes the SDK.
- Automatic Messages now correctly adapt to the relevant language settings in circumstances that previously caused a mismatch.
- Using the Control History API while in Fragment Mode will no longer show a blank screen instead of a "no conversations" message.
- Using Quick Replies and Emojis no longer occasionally duplicates the unread message banner.
- Fixed several issues related to what TalkBack reads to users.

### Important Notes for Developers
- Resource misspelled as `snachbar_duration_for_accessibility` has been renamed to `snackbar_duration_for_accessibility`; if you override this value, please update the override accordingly.
- PushMessage method misspelled as `getCurrentUnreadMessgesCounter()` has been renamed to `getCurrentUnreadMessagesCounter()`; if you use this method, you will need to update it in your code.
- Class `MonitoringParams` was moved from package `com.liveperson.sdk` to `com.liveperson.monitoring.sdk` to better reflect its class associations; updating your `import` statements may be necessary.
- Interface `EngagementCallbacks` was moved from package `com.liveperson.sdk.callbacks` to `com.liveperson.monitoring.sdk.callbacks` to better reflect its class associations; updating your `import` statements may be necessary.
