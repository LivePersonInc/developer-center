The Conversation Builder Platform's Knowledge Base tool allows you to export an existing Knowledge Base or create new Knowledge Base articles which will then be processed by our NLU engine. This allows your bot/automation to leverage [intents](placeholder.com) and [entities](placeholder.com) in order to recommend the most accurate Knowledge Base articles to an inquiring user. A fully defined intents library, alongside a robust Knowledge Center equipped with the right articles and training questions, allow you to create an intelligent support bot/automation, able to easily understand your user's inquiry and recommend the most relevant information to assist them.

### Adding a Knowledge Center

The first step to using Knowledge Center tool is to add a knowledge center entity by clicking the **ADD KNOWLEDGE CENTER** panel on the left side of your screen, once you've selected Knowledge Center from the main Conversation Builder Platform page. You will then be prompted to choose a name for the Knowledge Center and to select whether you'd like to import a pre-configured knowledge center from a CSV file or a Google Spreadsheet. **Importing a knowledge center from a file is not mandatory. Simply click "next" without selecting a file if you'd like to start with a blank one**.
