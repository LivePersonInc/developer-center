If you don't have a specific use case in mind, simply browse the site to find out more about our API capabilities and features. The LivePerson Developer Center is comprised of the following sections:

* **Guides** - this section includes general guides to using our APIs and SDKs. These work across all of our APIs, except where otherwise mentioned. In this section you can find documents on topics like Authentication, how to retrieve API keys, using Engagement Attributes and more.

* **Consumer Experience** - this section includes documentation pertaining to features which impact, manipulate or influence the consumer experience (e.g. the interface with which a consumer starts an interaction with your brand).

* **Agent Interactions** - this section includes documentation pertaining to agent behavior, workspace and features.

* **Data** - this section includes documentation pertaining to LivePerson's data storage, analysis and reporting capabilities.

* **Real Time Interactions** - this section includes documentation pertaining to events which are fired or information that is passed during a conversation.

* **Account Configuration** - this section includes documentation pertaining to APIs which allow you to configure your Conversational Cloud account via REST calls. This allows you to perform bulk actions with greater ease on your account or configure it programmatically, according to rules which you determine.

* **Admin** - this section includes documentation pertaining to APIs which allow you to configure various administration features on your account, such as creating new skills, agent groups and more. Much like the Account Configuration documents, this allows you to perform bulk actions with greater ease on your account or configure it programmatically, according to rules which you determine.
