The LINE connector now provides Structured Content Templates that are rendered by LINE. When agents or bots on Conversational Cloud share structured content templates, consumers will view the rendered templates via the LINE app.

See the [Structured Content Introduction](structured-content-introduction-to-structured-content.html) for more basic information about Structured Content templates and elements.
