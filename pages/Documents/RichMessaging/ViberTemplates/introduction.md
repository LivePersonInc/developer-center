### Overview

With Viber, brands can communicate with consumers through the Viber Messaging Application. Viber has a range of rich media and rich messaging capabilities, providing an enhanced messaging experience.

The Viber connector now provides Structured Content Templates that are rendered by Viber. When agents or bots on Conversational Cloud share structured content templates, consumers will view the rendered templates via the Viber app.

See the [Structured Content Introduction](structured-content-introduction-to-structured-content.html) for more basic information about Structured Content templates and elements.
