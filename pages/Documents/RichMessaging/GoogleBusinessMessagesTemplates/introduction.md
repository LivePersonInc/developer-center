### Overview

Google Business Messages (GBM) enables customers to contact a brand through Google Maps or Google Search. Google Business Messages provides enhanced messaging capabilities like Rich Cards, Carousels and Quick Replies.

The GBM connector now provides Structured Content Templates that are rendered by Google. When agents or bots on Conversational Cloud share structured content templates, consumers will view the rendered templates via the Android Messages app.

See the [Structured Content Introduction](structured-content-introduction-to-structured-content.html) for more basic information about Structured Content templates and elements.
