### Overview

The [Quick Reply template](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages/quick-replies) provides a way to receive consumer input to a question/statement by a set of buttons that each contain a title text and/or emojis. The quick reply options always appear above the message composition in the Facebook Messenger window, and will be published in the conversation thread upon consumer selection.

Quick Replies for Facebook Messenger includes a set of up to 13 buttons that can each contain a text title and a publish text click action.

Please note that should you want to share a question/statement before sending the quick replies, the text message should be shared with the JSON.

Below is an image of a Quick Reply template with four quick replies:

### Limitations

To create unified layouts when looking to use the **Quick Replies** Messenger template, please use these limitation/guidelines to create layouts:

* Facebook has a maximum of 13 replies in each quick reply template. Conversational Cloud does not have a limit on the number of replies.
* Facebook does not allow more than 20 characters on button title text.  Conversational Cloud will allow up to 128 characters.
* Facebook allows sharing images within quick replies — this is not supported with the template, however.
