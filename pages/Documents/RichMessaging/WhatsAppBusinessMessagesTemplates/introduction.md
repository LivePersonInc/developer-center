### Overview 

WhatsApp Business messaging enables customers to contact a brand through WhatsApp. It provides enhanced messaging capabilities like Interactive Messages.

The WhatsApp connector now provides Structured Content Templates that are rendered by WhatsApp. When agents or bots on Conversational Cloud share structured content templates, consumers will view the rendered templates via the WhatsApp app.

See the [Structured Content Introduction](structured-content-introduction-to-structured-content.html) for more basic information about Structured Content templates and elements.

The connector now also supports Product Messaging. This functionality allows a brand to send a single or multiple products to a WhatsApp user.
In order for a brand to send product messages they will need to connect a catalog to the LivePerson Business ID as a partner as well as to their WABA.
