Engagement attributes (EAs) passed by the brand can include important information that the agent should consider in real time, while engaging with customers. Unauthenticated EAs give brands the ability to provide agents with real-time information about the visitor in order to improve their efficiency and service quality in messaging conversations as well as in chat. For example, they can provide agents with an order ID for when visitors inquire about the terms and conditions of their order, or provide agents with customer information during a conversation with a registered visitor.

This feature will display unauthenticated EAs passed in a messaging conversation within the Agent Workspace. Any EAs passed 12 hours before the conversation has started, and 12 hours after a conversation has ended, will be attributed to the conversation.

EAs will be presented in the Agent Workspace in several areas:

1. **Consumer Info widget** - each EA will be presented in its own section, much like for chat conversations today. They will be available in both Open Conversations and All Conversations, as well as in the Conversation History widget.

2. **All Conversations view** - users will be able to search unauthenticated EAs in the All Conversations table, as part of the EAs search.

The table below explains which EAs should be collected and presented in LE UI.

**Note:** If you pass the `customerId` parameter of the Customer Info SDE, Conversational Cloud will treat the conversation as authenticated. Since Messaging conversations are unauthenticated in the context of SDEs, **do not pass this parameter**. If you do, our server will look for other prerequisites of authenticated conversations and the call will fail.

### Monitored Data

The following monitored data will be added to the Consumer Info widget under Consumer Info section (same as in chat)

1. Country

2. City

3. ISP

4. Organization

5. Referrer (start page)

6. IP Address (don't forget to take **IP masking** into consideration)

The monitored data will be collected from the first session. Geo location will be collected from when the conversation first originated, and will not update if the user changes their location during an open conversation.

Both unauthenticated EAs and monitored data will be available to view in the Agent Widget SDK, and through the Messaging Interactions API.

**Limitations**

1. EAs submitted more than 12 hours before conversation started will not be displayed

2. EAs submitted more than 12 hours after conversation ended will not be displayed

3. This includes resuming a conversation — if resume was done in the 12 hour time frame from conversation close time, the relevant EAs will be shown

4. Unauthenticated conversations started from different browsers will be treated as separate conversations and will have their own EAs

5. In an authenticated messaging flow, consumer info EAs must be sent after the login process in order to create a correlation of the user between devices and browsers

6. EAs submitted in a messaging conversation will be available for search in All Conversations up two hours later. EAs may appear before, but might not be the most current ones. Avg. estimated time for final EAs to appear would be ~30 min.

### Submitting EAs

In Messaging, the EAs are cross-device and linked to a specific conversation. There is no need to report the EAs separately on each page anew but only once per conversation. It is highly recommended to report the EAs at the beginning of the engagement with the consumer (as soon as the info exists, report on it).
EAs can be submitted from multiple sources such as the Monitoring API, or through more [Traditional Channels](engagement-attributes-types.html).

In case there is any additional information about the user during the interaction, you may send the same EAs again in order to update the existing data with the new information.

**Availablity of EAs**

- All Reported EAs within 12 hours before the Conversation  started, while the conversation is open, and 12 hours after the conversation has closed will be available.

- EAs will be reported with the specific consumer ID or EAs will be assigned to the "visitor" (in web messaging) that started the conversation.

- EAs will be available through API calls in a matter of seconds.

- EAs will be searchable in the UI up to 2 hours since they were received.

**Sending an EA multiple times during a session**

Consider the following implementation on a customer page:

| Page | property1 Value | property2 Value | property3 Value |
|----|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Page A | a1 | a2 | [Not supplied] |
| Page B | b1 | [Not supplied] | b3 |

A visitor has been to page A, then moved to page B.  How will the Engagement attributes be saved? The behavior depends on the Engagement Attribute (EA) type. Note that, unlike the best practices defined for chat, the only two behaviors we used in Messaging is **Append** and **Replace**. Which EA should use which behavior in Messaging is covered in the table below.

| Behavior | Behavior description | Engagement attributes | Example Output |
|----|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| *Append New Item* | Appends new item each time EA is sent | Viewed Product (prodView) <br> Visitor Error (error) <br> Transaction (purchase) <br> Lead <br> Searched Content | Product 1: <br> property1: a1 <br> property2: a2 <br> Product 2: <br> property1: b1 <br> property3: b3 |
| *Replace Item* | Updates existing info, does not maintain previous values of attributes that were not supplied in latest update | Cart update, <br> Personal Info (personal) <br> Customer Info (ctmrinfo) <br> Marketing Info (mrktInfo)  <br> Service Activity (service) | Cart: <br> property1: b1 <br> property3: b3 |

* Note: As opposed to _Chat_, updated behavior does not apply to the data, and *replace* behavior will be used instead. It's recommended to always pass the full data in the engagement attribute.

**Limitation**

- In authenticated messaging flow, consumer info EAs must be sent after the login process in order to create a correlation of the user between devices and browsers
