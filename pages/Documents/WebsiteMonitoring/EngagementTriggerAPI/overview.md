### Introduction

This API enables brands to get information about an engagement displayed on the page as well as programmatically interact with that engagement. For example: a Virtual Agent can display an escalation to chat option only if the related engagement is in "online" mode. The Virtual Agent can programmatically click on an engagement to escalate to chat.

API namespace: ```lpTag.taglets.rendererStub```
