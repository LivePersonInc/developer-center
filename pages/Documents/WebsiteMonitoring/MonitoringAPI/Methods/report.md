**Note:** Please make sure the read the [overview](rt-interactions-monitor-api-overview.html) before getting started with this method.

### Description

Use this method to access the LivePerson monitoring system in order to report information regarding consumer activity within the brand's account. Such information can include engagement attributes or entry points.
As engagement attributes are considered unauthenticated, it should not be used for business transactions that requires stronger authentication or information reliability.

### Use cases

* Report on consumer engagement-attributes from any entry point within the App.

### Request

| Method | URL |
| :--- | :--- |
|PUT|https://[{domain}](/agent-domain-domain-api.html)/api/account/{account-id}/app/{app-installation-id}/report?v={api-version}&vid={visitor-id}&sid={session-id}&obh=false |

### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Type | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| account-id | LP site ID | string |  |
| app-installation-id | App installation id | string | String, Required. This is received after installing the application, [as explained here](rt-interactions-monitoring-app-install.html) |

### Query parameters

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| v | API version number | double | Required | Supported Value: 1.0, 1.1 |
| vid | Visitor Id | String | Optional on first request, otherwise required | If session doesn't exist, a new session will be generated and sent by the server |
| sid | Session Id | String | Optional on first request, otherwise required |  Will be provided by the server-side in a 201(CREATED) response for this specific consumer and device and should be set by the client-side on all the subsequent requests to the server |
| obh | is On Behalf | Boolean | Optional | possible values: true/ false (the default is `false`). This parameter can be used (by passing `true`) to let LP servers know that this request is on behalf of the visitor (and not coming from the visitor himself), so the servers should NOT update the visitor Geo-location meta-data according to this request IP |

### Body Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| consumerId | Consumer Id (deprecated) | string | Optional, deprecated — use identities instead <sup>[1]</sup>|  |
| identities | List of identities | string (JSON) | Optional |  |
| identities.iss | URL for domain issuer | string | Optional | For unauth this is the csds-domain/account-id, for authenticated the brand should supply the URL |
| identities.acr | ACR — account config read | string | Required for each identity | supported value: loa1 |
| identities.sub | The subject for identification | string | Required | |
| engagementAttributes | Array of engagement attributes | string | Required | Supports all engagement-attributes including the impression events (inherited from ImpressionEventBase), see limitations item below |
| pageId | Page identification for sending events on the current engagement | String | Optional | If not provided a random  pageId will be generated
| entryPoints | List of entry points in the external system relevant for the engagement | Comma delimited list of strings | Optional | Example: ["http://one.url","tel://972672626"] <br><br> At least one form of identification is required (ConsumerID or VisitorID).

<sup>[1]</sup> At least one form of identification is required (`consumerId` / an `identities.sub` or `vid`).

### Security considerations

* To avoid security problems and increase reliability, the `consumerId` or the `sub` key of the `identities` array (depending on which one you use) described in the table above must meet the following requirements:

   * **Unguessable** - using consumerID or a `sub` value which is based on any of the consumer's public information, such as name, email address, phone number, etc. can be guessed easily and is not recommended.

   * **Innumerable** - the consumerID cannot be comprised of serial numbers and must be a set of characters that have no structure, form, or scheme.

   * **Unique per user** - the consumerID cannot be recycled from one user to another. Do not reuse the same consumerID for more than one user, even if this user is not active anymore.

* A good consumerID would be:

   * UUID assigned specifically and uniquely for consumer  

   * a hashed/salted email address

* For authenticated messaging flows: In order to support continuity and reporting, the consumerID must match the 'sub' claim reported inside the JWT. See [Authentication → Detailed API](/guides-authentication-detailedapi.html) for additional information on authentication.

| 202 | Loading account | Retry 4 times with 3, 10, 30, 90 seconds pause interval between retries |

<div class="important">Specifically in the case of a "Loading account" response (500 in API version 1.0, 202 in API version 1.1), it is important to retrieve the value of the <code>vid</code> from the response body and append it as the value of the <code>vid</code> query param for the retry request (to be issued following a pause interval of a few seconds).</div>

### Limitations

| Area | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Impression Events | All impression events could be reported only within same session where engagement has been created. That is, session must have engagement-context-id for corresponding engagement. The impression events cannot be reported to newly created session without invocation of /engagement API |
