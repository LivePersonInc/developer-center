**Note:** Please make sure the read the [overview](rt-interactions-monitoring-overview.html) before getting started with this method.

### Description

Use this method to access the LivePerson monitoring system in order to retrieve an engagement with an updated state of availability for a consumer. The eligibility of an engagement is based on campaign definitions and possibly also on information regarding consumer activity within the brand's account, such as engagement attributes.

### Use cases

1. Obtain an engagement. An engagement will be provided if both the following apply:
  * there is no active conversation for this consumer
  * the consumer is eligible for an engagement

{:start="2"}
2. Obtain the identifiers of an active conversation for this consumer, if one exists.

### Request

| Method | URL |
| :--- | :--- |
|POST|https://[{domain}](/agent-domain-domain-api.html)/api/account/{account-id}/app/{app-installation-id}/engagement?v={api-version}&vid={visitor-id}&sid={session-id}&obh=false |

### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Type | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| account-id | LP site ID | string | |
| app-installation-id | App installation id | string | String, Required. This is received after installing the application, [as explained here](rt-interactions-monitoring-app-install.html) |

### Query parameters

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| v | API version number | double | Required | Supported Value: 1.0, 1.1  |
| vid | Visitor Id | String | Optional | Must be saved in order to reuse for future requests in the same visit |
| sid | Session Id | String | Optional on first request, otherwise required | Will be provided by the server-side in a 201 (CREATED) response for this specific consumer and device and should be set by the client-side on all the subsequent requests to the server |
| obh | is On Behalf | Boolean | Optional | possible values: true/ false (the default is `false`). This parameter can be used (by passing `true`) to let LP servers know that this request is on behalf of the visitor (and not coming from the visitor himself), so the servers should NOT update the visitor Geo-location meta-data according to this request IP |

### Body Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| consumerId | Consumer Id (deprecated) | string | Optional, deprecated — use identities instead |  |
| identities | List of identities | string (JSON) | Optional |  |
| identities.iss | URL for domain issuer | string | Optional | For unauth this is the csds-domain/account-id, for authenticated the brand should supply the URL |
| identities.acr | ACR — account config read | string | Required for each identity | Supported values: "0" for unauth, "loa1" for auth  |
| identities.sub | The subject for identification | string | Required | |
| clientProperties | Optional JSON format with the following fields: Type, Platform, Name, Version, Client timestamp | string | Optional | JSON structure — The main purpose of this information is for troubleshooting and visibility of the consumer SDK / app version that manages the communication with the server side. |
| clientProperties.appVersion | Application version | string | Optional | Example: For mobile it will be the host app version |
| clientProperties.deviceFamily | | string | Optional | Example: personal_computer/tablet/mobile_phone <br> Supported values: "DESKTOP", "TABLET", "MOBILE" |
| clientProperties.ipAddress | IP address (V4) | string | Optional | (IP format XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX) <br> Validation: Real IP address (IPv4) |
| clientProperties.os | Contains the operating system, including version info | string | Optional | Supported values: "WINDOWS", "MAC_OSX", "LINUX", "IOS", "ANDROID" |
| clientProperties.osVersion | OS version | string | Optional | Example: For Android it could be 2.4 |
| entryPoints | List of entry points in the external system relevant for the engagement | Comma delimited list of strings | Optional | Example: ["http://one.url","tel://972672626"] |
| engagementAttributes | Array of engagement attributes | string | Optional | Supported Values: all engagement-attributes excluding the type of ImpressionEvent (Java version inherited from ImpressionEventBase).  |

### Security considerations

* To avoid security problems and increase reliability, the `consumerId` or the `sub` key of the `identities` array (depending on which one you use) described in the table above must meet the following requirements:

   * **Unguessable** - using consumerID or a `sub` value which is based on any of the consumer's public information, such as name, email address, phone number, etc. can be guessed easily and is not recommended.

   * **Innumerable** - the consumerID cannot be comprised of serial numbers and must be a set of characters that have no structure, form, or scheme.

   * **Unique per user** - the consumerID cannot be recycled from one user to another. Do not reuse the same consumerID for more than one user, even if this user is not active anymore.

* A good consumerID would be:

   * UUID assigned specifically and uniquely for consumer

   * a hashed/salted email address

* For authenticated messaging flows: In order to support continuity and reporting, the consumerID must match the 'sub' claim reported inside the JWT. See [Authentication → Detailed API](/guides-authentication-detailedapi.html) for additional information on authentication.
