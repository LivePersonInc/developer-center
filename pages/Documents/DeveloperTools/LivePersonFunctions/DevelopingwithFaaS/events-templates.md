### Events

LivePerson Functions' `lambdas` can be connected to Conversational Cloud events at the time of [creation](function-as-a-service-getting-started.html#step-1-choose-a-template). Once those `lambdas` are deployed, they will be executed whenever these events are triggered. Each event comes with a set of connected templates that can be used as an initial scaffolding for the developing the `lambda`.

{: .notice}
The amount of lambdas connected to a specific event is restricted and can be seen in the table below.

Currently the following events are supported:

|Event Name|Event Description|Event Source|Lambda Limit|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Chat Post Survey E-Mail Transcript|Triggered after a chat conversation is finished and CSAT survey has been submitted.<br/> For more details on how to set up a function like this one, please see details [here](liveperson-functions-integrations-post-chat-survey-transcripts.html).|Chat Service (Consumer Post chat survey)|10|
|Conversational Command|Use this event to implement a Conversational Command that can be invoked from within the agent workspace in Conversational Cloud by typing "/".<br/> For more details on how to set up a function like this one, please see details [here](liveperson-functions-integrations-conversational-commands.html). |Agent Workspace (NAW only)|30|
|Messaging Conversation End|Triggered when the conversation is closed by agent/consumer/system.<br/> For more details on how to set up a function like this one, please see details [here](liveperson-functions-integrations-messaging-conversations.html).|Conversational Exchange Service (Messaging Auto Messages)|1|
|Messaging Conversation Idle|Triggered when agent/consumer is not responsive or the conversation is in queue for over X secs/mins. Where Time X is configurable inside the Conversational Cloud UI, via the auto-messages feature.<br/> For more details on how to set up a function like this one, please see details [here](liveperson-functions-integrations-messaging-conversations.html).|Conversational Exchange Service (Messaging Auto Messages)|1|
|Messaging Conversation Routing|Triggered when the conversation is transferred to a different skill.<br/> For more details on how to set up a function like this one, please see details [here](liveperson-functions-integrations-messaging-conversations.html).|Conversational Exchange Service (Messaging Auto Messages)|1|
|Messaging Line in Off-Hours|Triggered when a conversation was *opened* during office-hours, but a new consumer line in the conversation is *written* during off-hours (essentially when a consumer sends an off-hour message). <br/> For more details on how to set up a function like this one, please see details [here](liveperson-functions-integrations-messaging-conversations.html).|Conversational Exchange Service (Messaging Auto Messages)|1|
|Messaging New Conversation|Triggered for every new messaging conversation. **This event should not be used for routing. Use a routing bot instead.** <br/>For more details on how to set up a function like this one, please see details [here](liveperson-functions-integrations-messaging-conversations.html).|ControllerBot|1|
|Messaging Participants Change|Triggered on every participant (agent) change (joins/leaves) a messaging conversation. <br/> For more details on how to set up a function like this one, please see details [here](liveperson-functions-integrations-messaging-conversations.html).|Conversational Exchange Service (Messaging Auto Messages)|1|
|Messaging Survey Ended|Triggered when a messaging post survey ended.<br/> For more details on how to set up a function like this one, please see details [here](liveperson-functions-integrations-messaging-conversation-survey.html).|Post Survey Bot|1|
|Messaging Survey Started|Triggered when a messaging post survey started.<br/> For more details on how to set up a function like this one, please see details [here](liveperson-functions-integrations-messaging-conversation-survey.html).|Post Survey Bot|1|
|Messaging TTR (Time to Respond)|Triggered when the consumer marks a response as an urgent response, unmarks a response as urgent, or the agent manually updates the response time.<br/> For more details on how to set up a function like this one, please see details [here](liveperson-functions-integrations-messaging-conversations.html). |Conversational Exchange Service (Messaging Auto Messages)|1|
|No Event|Used for lambdas which only can be invoked externally|-||
|Third-Party Bots Custom Integration|Triggered when a bot, which is using the Third-Party Bots' Custom Integration receives a message.<br/> For more details on how to set up a function like this one, please see details [here](liveperson-functions-integrations-conversational-ai.html).|Bot Connector|15|
|Third-Party Bots Post Hook|Triggered when a bot, which is using the Third-Party Bots' Post Hooks receives a message. The function will be invoked after the vendor responded.<br/> For more details on how to set up a function like this one, please see details [here](liveperson-functions-integrations-conversational-ai.html).|Bot Connector|15|
|Third-Party Bots Pre Hook|Triggered when a bot, which is using the Third-Party Bots' Post Hooks receives a message. The function will be invoked before the vendor receives the payload.<br/> For more details on how to set up a function like this one, please see details [here](liveperson-functions-integrations-conversational-ai.html).|Bot Connector|15|
|Third-Party Bots Error Hook|Triggered when a bot, which is using the Third-Party Bots' Error Hooks is having an issue.<br/> For more details on how to set up a function like this one, please see details [here](liveperson-functions-integrations-conversational-ai.html).|Bot Connector|15|


Each of these events also has an event specific input (payload) associated with it, that the triggering system will provide at runtime. When using the [Invoke](function-as-a-service-deploying-functions.html#testing-your-function) screen, this payload is shown on the left-hand side. During development, the event payload of the `lambda` is visible on the right-hand side at the sidebar-tab. See the [Payload](function-as-a-service-developing-with-faas-overview.html#editor-sidebar) section for more information.

### Templates

Additionally, Functions offers a number of templates. They can be used as a sample to kick-start the development of custom scenarios. Some of them are connected to events which the template list below is grouped by. Templates which have the same name as the related event are to be considered the default template for an event.
