### Events

LivePerson Functions' `lambdas` can be connected to Conversational Cloud events at the time of [creation](function-as-a-service-getting-started.html#step-1-choose-a-template). Once those `lambdas` are deployed, they will be executed whenever these events are triggered. Each event comes with a set of connected templates that can be used as an initial scaffolding for the developing the `lambda`.

{: .notice}
The amount of lambdas connected to a specific event is restricted and can be seen in the table below.

Currently the following events are supported:

|Event Name|Event Description|Event Source|Lambda Limit| Supports Skills|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |---
|Chat Post Survey E-Mail Transcript|Triggered after a chat conversation is finished and CSAT survey has been submitted.<br/> For more details on how to set up a function like this one, please see details [here](liveperson-functions-integrations-post-chat-survey-transcripts.html).|Chat Service (Consumer Post chat survey)|10|

|Third-Party Bots Error Hook|Triggered when a bot, which is using the Third-Party Bots' Error Hooks is having an issue.<br/> For more details on how to set up a function like this one, please see details [here](liveperson-functions-integrations-conversational-ai.html).|Bot Connector|15|


Each of these events also has an event specific input (payload) associated with it, that the triggering system will provide at runtime. When using the [Invoke](function-as-a-service-deploying-functions.html#testing-your-function) screen, this payload is shown on the left-hand side. During development, the event payload of the `lambda` is visible on the right-hand side at the sidebar-tab. See the [Payload](function-as-a-service-developing-with-faas-overview.html#editor-sidebar) section for more information.

#### Support for limiting invocations by skills

Specific events can be restricted to only invoke a lambda on certain skills. This grants you more control over when your lambda is invoked, saving you lines of boilerplate code as-well-as reducing the number of meaningless invocations.

<img src="img/faas-select-skill.png" alt="Functions select skill" style="width:100%;"/>

To specify to which skill the lambda should react, simply select the skills during the creation/editing process of your lambda. By default, the lambda will react to all skills. If the lambda should only react to specific skills then there is a maximum of <b>50</b> skills that can be selected at any given time. 

You can create more than one lambda of the same event if you set different skills for each of the lambdas. If you do not assign a skill to the lambda you are only allowed to have one lambda of the given event. 
Some example scenarios:
✅ Event A, Skill 1,2 + Event A, Skill 3,4
✅ Event A, Skill 1,2 + Event A, Skill 3,4 + Event B, Default-skill
✅ Event A, Default-skill
❌ Event A, Skill 1,2 + Event A, Skill 3,4 +  Default-skill

<img src="img/faas-select-skill-2.png" alt="Functions select multiple skill" style="width:100%;"/>

<div class="important">Changing the skills of a lambda does not require a redeployment. The change is reflected within 5 minutes after saving.</div>

### Templates

Additionally, Functions offers a number of templates. They can be used as a sample to kick-start the development of custom scenarios. Some of them are connected to events which the template list below is grouped by. Templates which have the same name as the related event are to be considered the default template for an event.

Each of these events also has an event specific input (payload) associated with it, that the triggering system will provide at runtime. When using the [Invoke](function-as-a-service-deploying-functions.html#testing-your-function) screen, this payload is shown on the left-hand side. During development, the event payload of the `lambda` is visible on the right-hand side at the sidebar-tab.
