### Bot Connector
LivePerson Functions allow you to write your own custom bot and connect it to Conversational Cloud. By doing so no external vendors (e.g. IBM Watson) need to be used. See more information about [Custom Integration](third-party-bots-custom-integration.html).

### Conversation Builder
Users who are tasked with creating bots in Conversation Builder can easily integrate function calls within their dialog flows. Adding this kind of [integration interaction](conversation-builder-conversation-builder-interactions.html#integrations) to a dialog in a bot works just like adding any other type of integration interaction.

Before a function can be used in an interaction, users who are tasked with more technical work in Conversation Builder must first 1) [create and deploy the function](liveperson-functions-getting-started.html) in the LivePerson Functions UI, and then 2) [add a Function (FaaS) integration](conversation-builder-integrations-liveperson-functions-integrations.html) to the bot in Conversation Builder. This makes the integration available for use in a bot interaction.

As part of the invocation, the bot can pass a payload into the function. This payload is specific to the triggered bot interaction. This means that, depending on the interaction, the function will have different data available as an input.

### Conversation Orchestrator Conversation Context Service
The [Conversation Orchestrator Conversation Context Service](maven-context-warehouse-overview.html) is a centralized repository of brand, customer, conversational, session, and custom attributes. Those attributes can be used by [Conversation Orchestrator](maven-overview.html) throughout the customerâ€™s conversation journey or for routing policies.

Whith LivePerson Functions it is possible to connect a custom attribute with a function, which fetches the value of the attribute from an external source at runtime. For example this empowers Conversation Orchestrator to retrieve customer information from a Salesforce CRM database in real time. 

### Context Session Store
The [Context Session Store](conversation-orchestrator-conversation-context-service-overview.html) is used to store conversation session state data (e.g. agent notes) in the Conversational Cloud. Due to its versatility, LivePerson Functions also uses this service as a [temporary data storage](liveperson-functions-developing-with-faas-data-storage.html).
