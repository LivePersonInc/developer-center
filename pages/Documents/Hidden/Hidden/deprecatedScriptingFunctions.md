The following scripting functions were deprecated and removed from the doc on 10/23/2019. Keeping here in the exclude folder for historical purposes.

### Get User Location

When you create a Required Context of type Location, a Location object is created.

You can retrieve this object with `getUserLocation()`, and access the properties of the location object by assigning it to a local variable and then calling several `get` methods on the object.

| Function Name | Arguments | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `getUserLocation()` | None | location object |

#### Example

```javascript
var location = botContext.getUserLocation();
var city = location.getState(); // two-letter state abbreviation
var lat = location.getLatitude();
var lon = location.getLongitude();
var zip = location.getZipCode(); // postal code
```

You can also access the location information with the {$location} variable, for instance:

- City: {$location.city}
- State: {$location.state}
- ZipCode: {$location.zip}
- Latitude: {$location.lat}
- Longitude: {$location.lng}
- combined Lat,Lng {$location.latlng}.

### Get and Set UserName

The get UserName and set UserName functions are used to get (and set) the value of a permanent variable, dedicated to the user’s name. Having this dedicated variable makes it easy to consistently set the user’s information.

| Function Name | Arguments | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `getUserName()` | None | string |
| `setUserName(name)` | name (string) | None |

#### Example

```javascript
// retrieve the username and test
var username = botContext.getUserName();
if(username != null){
  botContext.printDebugMessage('User Name = ' + username);
  botContext.sendMessage('Hi'  + username + '! Thanks for coming');
}else{
  // if it doesn’t exist, set it
  botContext.setUserName('Fred');
}
```

### Get and Set User Email Address

The get Email and set Email functions are used to get (and set) the value of a permanent variable, dedicated to the user’s email address. Having this dedicated variable makes it easy to consistently set the user’s information.

| Function Name | Arguments | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `getEmail()` | None | string |
| `setEmail(address)` | address (string) | None |

#### Example

```javascript
// retrieve the user’s email address and test
var email = botContext.getEmail();
if (email != null) {
  botContext.printDebugMessage('User Email Address = ' + email);
  botContext.sendMessage('Looks like your email address is ' + email);
} else {
  // if it doesn’t exist, set it
  botContext.setEmail('fred@fred.net');
}
```

The following scripting function was never re-added to the Dev Center (after being removed at one point) because getUserChannel exists. (07-25-2020)

### Get user platform type
Returns the type of platform that the user is currently communicating on. This function returns:

* SMS
* INAPP (for In-app SDK)
* FACEBOOK
* ABC (for Apple Business Chat, now called Apple Messages for Business)
* RCS
* WHATSAPP

| Function Name | Arguments | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `getUserPlatformType()` | None | SMS, INAPP, FACEBOOK, ABC, RCS, or WHATSAPP |

#### Example

```javascript
var channel = botContext.getUserPlatformType();
botContext.printDebugMessage("channel used by the user is: " + channel);
```
