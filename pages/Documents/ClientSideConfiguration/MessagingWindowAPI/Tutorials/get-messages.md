In this tutorial we will demonstrate the mechanism that enables the consumer to get messages sent by the agent. These messages may be sent while the consumer is connected or offline.

### Prerequisites

At the end of the [Getting Started](consumer-int-getting-started.html) tutorial, we created the ``lp.env`` file. In order to launch ``lp-shell`` with your previous settings, type the following:

```sh
docker run --env-file lp.env -it lpinc/shell
```
You should get a shell line.

Make sure that you have closed any previous conversation sessions by clicking ``Close conversation`` in the Agent Workspace.

### Step 1 — Find Your Consumer ID

When you get messages from the server, you must identify which messages were published by you, and which were published by the agent. To do so, you must know your ``consumerId``. To find out your ``consumerId``, refer to the content of the LP_JWT by base64-decoding the middle part of the JWT (between the two periods):

```sh
echo $LP_JWT | sed -e 's/.*\.\(.*\)\..*/\1/' | base64 --decode
```

You will now be able to see the content of the JWT:

```json
{
	"sub": "19f98cd2-63b9-42e4-bc0d-9222b86574e1",
	"aud": "acc:qa57221676",
	"iss": "https://idp.liveperson.net",
	"exp": 1879957364,
	"iat": 1469717324
}
```

The ``sub`` property contains your ``consumerId``.

**Note:** If you encounter issues when using the shell ``base64`` command, you can use online tools such as [base64decode.org](https://www.base64decode.org/).

### Step 2 — Create a Conversation

Open the WebSocket connection using the following:

```sh
wscat -k 60 -H "Authorization:jwt $LP_JWT" -c "wss://$LP_ASYNCMESSAGINGENT/ws_api/account/$LP_ACCOUNT/messaging/consumer?v=3"
```

Replace the ``__LP_ACCOUNT__`` with your account ID, and then send a request on the connection to create a new conversation with the following JSON object:

```json
{"kind":"req","id":1,"type":"cm.ConsumerRequestConversation"}
```

In response, you will get the ID of the new conversation.

```json
{
	"kind": "resp",
	"reqId": "1",
	"code": 200,
	"body": {
		"conversationId": "7507be78-60ef-4468-b3b1-baa47fbeea21"
	},
	"type": "cm.RequestConversationResponse"
}
```

Write down the ``conversationId`` from the response. We will need it in the next steps.

### Step 3 — Agent Sends Messages

In this stage, switch to the Agent Workspace from Step 1, and accept the ring of the incoming request. Click the blinking ``Accept`` button.

Type a few messages in the Agent Workspace.

### Step 4 — Subscribe to Conversation Content

In order to get existing or new messages from the agent side, the consumer should subscribe to the content of the conversation. Substitute the ``__YOUR_CONVERSATION_ID__`` with the ``consersationId`` you got in the response in the previous step, and paste it into the opened WebSocket.

```json
{"kind":"req","id":"22","body":{"fromSeq":0,"dialogId":"__YOUR_CONVERSATION_ID__"},"type":"ms.SubscribeMessagingEvents"}
```

**Note:** You can use the message builder (<a href="consumer-int-msg-sub-events.html"><i class="fa fa-magic" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>) to build the above message.

In response, you will get a subscription success message:

```json
{"kind":"resp","reqId":"22","code":200,"type":".ams.GenericSubscribeResponse"}
```

You will now get all the existing content of the conversation:

```json
{
	"kind": "notification",
	"body": {
		"changes": [
			{
				"sequence": 0,
				"originatorId": "734d9867-40e3-52b9-a401-07e877676d64",
				"serverTimestamp": 1477840831162,
				"event": {
					"type": "ContentEvent",
					"message": "message from the agent",
					"contentType": "text/plain"
				},
				"dialogId": "__YOUR_CONVERSATION_ID__"
			}
		]
	},
	"type": "ms.MessagingEventNotification"
}
```

You will notice that you get all the messages that were published by you, or by the agent. In order to find which messages were published by you, refer to the ``originatorPId`` field. Messages that were published by you will have a value equal to the ``consumerId`` you found in Step 1, while messages from the agent will have a different ``originatorId``.

Now close the conversation from the Agent Workspace by clicking ``Close conversation``.
