In order to show the agent which messages were accepted by the consumer device and which were read by the consumer, the client should publish read/accept receipts. The same events are published by the agent side and may be displayed to the consumer. In this tutorial we will see how to publish these events.

### Prerequisites

See [Prerequisites](consumer-int-get-msg.html#prerequisites).

### Step 1 — Create a Conversation

Open the WebSocket connection using:

```sh
wscat -k 60 -H "Authorization:jwt $LP_JWT" -c "wss://$LP_ASYNCMESSAGINGENT/ws_api/account/$LP_ACCOUNT/messaging/consumer?v=3"
```

Send a request on the connection to create a new conversation with the following JSON object:

```json
{"kind":"req","id":1,"type":"cm.ConsumerRequestConversation"}
```

In response, you will get the ID of the new conversation.

```json
{
	"kind": "resp",
	"reqId": "1",
	"code": 200,
	"body": {
		"conversationId": "7507be78-60ef-4468-b3b1-baa47fbeea21"
	},
	"type": "cm.RequestConversationResponse"
}
```

### Step 2 — Agent sends Messages

Switch to the Agent Workspace and click ``Accept`` to take the conversation.

Type a few messages in the Agent Workspace.

Switch again to the consumer API shell and to the open WebSocket connection. In the open WebSocket you should see a notification about the agent line. The notification message should be similiar to the following message:

```json
{
   "kind": "notification",
   "body": {
      "changes": [
         {
            "sequence": 3,
            "originatorId": "3d834d4d-8f0b-5708-9e17-115ae1da4ad1",
            "serverTimestamp": 1487455441507,
            "event": {
               "type": "ContentEvent",
               "message": "some agent text",
               "contentType": "text/plain"
            },
            "dialogId": "940f401e-dc4c-49a9-bff2-2bbb5bd0df64"
         }
      ]
   },
   "type": "ms.MessagingEventNotification"
}
```

You should see the text you type is displayed in the Agent Workspace in the ``message`` field. In this message, find the ``dialogId`` and the ``sequence`` fields.

### Step 3 — Publish Accept and Read Events

We will now publish an ``accept`` receipt for this message.

Type the following request to the WebSocket connection while substituting the __DIALOG_ID__ and the __SEQUENCE__ with the values from the above message.

```json
{"kind":"req","id":2,"type":"ms.PublishEvent","body":{"dialogId":"__DIALOG_ID__","event":{"type" : "AcceptStatusEvent" , "status" : "ACCEPT", "sequenceList" : [ __SEQUENCE__ ]}}}
```

Switch to the Agent Workspace. You will see that the a second "V" has appeared next to the agent message.

You can also try sending ``read`` receipts using a similar message.

```json
{"kind":"req","id":2,"type":"ms.PublishEvent","body":{"dialogId":"__DIALOG_ID__","event":{"type" : "AcceptStatusEvent" , "status" : "READ", "sequenceList" : [ __SEQUENCE__ ]}}}
```

If you now switch to the Agent Workspace, you will see that the "V"s appear in an orange color.
