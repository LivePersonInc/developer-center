This is the list of chat states that are published throughout the lifetime of the chat.

All chat states are published on the event listeners triggers or you can retrieve the current state by calling the `getState` method.

Some of the chat states are also published on separate listeners to which you can bind.

The states are there to help indicate the state of the chat API.

The enumeration for the states are exposed via `lpTag.taglets.ChatOverRestAPI.prototype.chatStates`.
