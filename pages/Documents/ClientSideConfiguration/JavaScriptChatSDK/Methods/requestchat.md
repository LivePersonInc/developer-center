This method queues a chat request. It has a number of possible properties that can be passed to specify Skill or ServiceQueue requested and other information about the visitor.

**For consumer Authentication flow please collect the necessary parameters from the [authenticate](consumer-experience-javascript-chat-authenticate.html) method first.**
The parameters in question are `conversationId`, `participantId`. You will need to add these parameters to the request body for the requestChat method.

**Notes:**

- If you displayed a Pre-chat survey, this is where you submit the answers to that survey.
- In response to a chat starting, the following events will be triggered: onStart, onState, onInfo and onLine (if there are any chat lines).
