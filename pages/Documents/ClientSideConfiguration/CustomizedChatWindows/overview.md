If you're looking to simply customize the default Conversational Cloud window, check out [our Window Customization API](window-customization-api-overview.html). The Customized Chat Windows API should be used for more involved projects where a custom window is built from scratch.

### Introduction

As part of our open platform, Conversational Cloud gives brands the ability to modify consumer interaction windows using APIs. These APIs allow brands to develop and deploy a unique chat experience for their consumers.

The triggering of an API-based consumer chat window is supported by both monitored and unmonitored flows.

Different types of engagements, funnel reporting, consumer authentication flow (OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect) and engagement attributes are supported as part of the solution.

### Flows

#### Monitored

On a monitored flow, once a consumer enters a web page tagged with the Web Tag, a consumer session is created and monitored by the Conversational Cloud monitoring system.

In order to trigger a customized window, an engagement with a dedicated API-based window should be created. Currently, this kind of window can be created manually by a LivePerson Administrator.

Once an engagement is presented and clicked on by the consumer, the engagement will trigger the corresponding chat window.

#### Unmonitored
When the Web Tag is not part of the flow, retrieving an engagement is the responsibility of the Chat API-based window service, using the App Engagement API.

**Engagement retrieval**

In order to display an engagement with an up-to-date availability state, you must access the LivePerson Monitoring system to create a consumer session and retrieve an engagement. This call is made by the `getEngagement()` function of the [App Engagement API](rt-interactions-app-engagement-overview.html) or directly from the [JS Chat API](consumer-experience-javascript-chat-getting-started.html).

**Using the Chat API**

1. Before requesting a chat, the Chat API-based window service can be rechecked for availability.

2. The service will then start a chat flow.
