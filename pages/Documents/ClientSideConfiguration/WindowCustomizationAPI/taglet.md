### Window Customization Taglet

The Window Customization Taglet allows brands to apply customizations using the Window Customization API without having to add a style sheet to your page.

This taglet is configured by the LivePerson account team based on the [Window Customization API structure and specification](window-customization-api-quick-start.html).

### Pros of using the taglet

* Applies the customization for all pages at once. If you don't use a taglet, you have to apply the CSS changes manually on each page.
* Only one place to maintain.
* The flexibility of turning it on/off

### Cons of using the taglet

* Has to be configured by the LivePerson account team.
* Does not allow to set different styles for different pages.

### Limitations

* Taglet can only be configured per [section](engagement-attributes-types-of-engagement-attributes.html#section) or for whole site.
