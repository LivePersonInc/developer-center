### Request

| Method | URL |

| POST | https://[{domain}](/agent-domain-domain-api.html)/api/account/{accountId}/chat/{chatId}/events?v=1&NC=true |

**Formats**

- XML
- JSON

**Request Headers**

| Header | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | LivePerson appKey=721c180b09eb463d9f3191c41762bb68 |
| Content-Type | application/json |
| Accept | application/json |

JSON Body Example: Adding a line:

```json
{
  "event":{
    "@type":"line","text":"hi"
  }
}
```

JSON Body Example: Ending a chat:

```json
{
  "event":{
    "@type":"state","state":"ended"
    }
}
```

**Notes:**

- This API does not support sending HTML, therefore HTML will be presented as text to the agent and will not be translated into its representation.

- The "ended" event ends the chat (and adds an "ended" event to the chat content), but it does NOT delete the chat session resource.

- Only one event can be added per POST event request.
