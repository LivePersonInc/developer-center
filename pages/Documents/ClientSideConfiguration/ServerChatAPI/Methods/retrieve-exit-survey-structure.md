| <a name="logic">Logic</a> | Exists if this question has any logic. | | Logic allows specified questions in surveys to be hidden or displayed to visitors based on the answers given to previous questions in a survey.

This behavior is set by the "showLogicId" element. Question Logic is particularly useful when the user might receive a long list of options that would not be as user-friendly in a single list; or you wish to hide conditional or required questions which might not be relevant for all users completing the survey. |
| showLogicId | The logic ID of the question to be displayed if this item is selected. | numeric | |
