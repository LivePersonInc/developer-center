### Introduction

{: .notice}
Our Data APIs enable you to retrieve many attributes and information types. Please refer to [API Data Metrics](https://developers.liveperson.com/api-data-metrics.html) for the different types of information and attributes which are retrievable via both our Historical and Real Time Data APIs.

Brands can now search, filter and keep copies of chat transcripts and related data, for example surveys, to later integrate and further analyze their data with third-party tools (DWH, CRM systems, etc.). 99.5 % of chat transcript data is available within 5 minutes. All other chat transcript data (including metadata like Engagement Attributes) is available within 2 hours after a chat has ended, and is stored for 13 months. The Engagement History API is based on the REST architecture style.

### Getting Started

A few things you'll need to get started with this API:

1. **Retrieve your domain**. Use the [LivePerson Domain API](agent-domain-domain-api.html) to retrieve this information by providing the following service name:

	* engHistDomain

2. This API requires authorization using API key.

	* [Follow the instructions](guides-gettingstarted.html), to create and use an API key.

3. Note the [API terms of use](https://www.liveperson.com/policies/apitou).



### Use Cases

* Extract all chat transcripts and accompanying data in order to integrate with any 3rd party application or database

* Extract types of conversations (e.g. low CSAT score) and take an action on them.
