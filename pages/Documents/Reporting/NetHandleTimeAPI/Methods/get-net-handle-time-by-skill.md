This method provides the Net Handle Time (NHT) at a skill level. The API  retrieves up to 9 weeks of information.

{: .alert}
Some metrics are calculated only in 60-minute intervals.
These metrics, when calling the API in a 15-minutes interval, will be replicated for each timeframe.

{: .note}
In case there is no data available, the response element will contain -1.

### Request

| Method | URL |
| --- | --- |
| GET | https://[{domain}](/agent-domain-domain-api.html)/operations/api/account/{accountId}/nht?fromDate={timestamp}&toDate={timestamp}&skillIds={comma separated skill ids}&interval={interval in minutes}&source={source name}&v={api version}

#### Request Query Parameters

| Name | Description | Type | Required? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v | The version of the API | Numeric | No | Two versions are supported: v1 and v2 (If not provided, will be set to v1 for backward compatibility). <br> **v1**: default version (basic maintenance). <br> **v2**: pagination support (maintained version) |
| source | Used to describe the originator of the call. The source name should be unique for every project/process within the organization | String | Yes | Source name should be up to 20 characters. <br> Example: LP_AgentUI |
| fromDate | Query period: Query start date | ISO format. UTC timezone | Yes — conditional | **fromMillis must not be provided**. <br> The query period will be limited to 1 week. <br> example format: 2021-07-05T05:00:00 |
| fromMillis | Query start date (same as above) in Epoch time format | long — Epoch time | Yes — conditional | **fromDate must not be provided**. <br> The query period will be limited to 1 week. <br> example format: 2021-07-05T05:00:00 |
| toDate | Query period: Query end date | ISO format. UTC timezone | Yes — conditional | **toMillis must not be provided**. <br> The query period will be limited to 1 week. <br> example format: 2021-07-05T05:00:00 |
| toMillis | Query end date (same as above) in Epoch time format | long — Epoch time | Yes — conditional | **toDate must not be provided**. <br> The query period will be limited to 1 week. <br> example format: 2021-07-05T05:00:00 |
| interval | Interval size in minutes. When provided, the returned data will be aggregated by intervals of the requested size. <br> The buckets will be rounded to the closest rounded time (e.g. 11:00, 11:15, 11:30) | Numeric | No | Available intervals: 15/30/60. <br> Default: 60 |
| skillIds | When provided, will return the information for the specific skills. Can be more than 1 skill | String | No | If not provided all skills will be returned. |
| limit | limits the number of skills per page | Numeric | Optional | Default = 10, Maximum = 10 |
| offset | staring skill offset | Numeric | Optional | Default = 0 |
