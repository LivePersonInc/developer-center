Retrieves the information about the current messaging queue state (and all its related metrics) in the account, skill and agent group level

**Notes:**

1. The messaging queue data is currently not available by default, in order to enable the data flow please contact your account manager.

2. These methods are subject to Rate-Limiting policies. This means that the maximum number of concurrent requests is limited on the server side. As most incoming requests are measured in seconds, the likelihood of your requests actually encountering an issue is rare; however, if you do encounter a limit, you can expect to receive a 429 status code in an error response from the server.

If your request is throttled in this manner, it is recommended that you provide a window of at least 1 second in between subsequent request retries. Clients who submit "bursty" traffic patterns to UMS may face rate-limiting issues, so it is recommended to smoothen traffic to a more distributed pattern whenever possible.

3. **Limitation**: in order for the queue data to appear, there must be at least one agent logged in to LE.
