### Introduction

Outbound Reporting product provides a complete message journey of the conversation from start to finish. The Outbound Reporting API provides a full funnel metrics number of messages/deflections sent, how many actually got delivered by the messaging channel, how many were read and responded back by the consumers. The goal of this feature is to stitch pre and post conversation events of every message/deflections and provide 360Â° analytical data to API clients.

### API provides reporting for below services
* Proactive Messaging 2.0
* Connect To Messaging 2.0

### Getting Started

**Who can access this Outbound Reporting API**

All Brands who use Proactive Messaging version 2.0 and Connect To Messaging version 2.0 have access to the Outbound Reporting API service.

**Why we need this feature**

As of today we don't have the capability to view full-funnel flow for a given transaction. The Outbound Reporting API feature will fill this gap.
What Message channels are supported in this API:
SMS - Twilio Messaging Gateway
INAPP - Liveperson Mobile SDK
WhatsApp
