Use Conversation Builder to design and scale with AI-powered bots. Our intuitive, point-and-click interface makes it easy to build bots and automate conversations.

### Bot building made easy
Even non-technical staff can build and optimize AI-powered chatbots. Conversation Builder offers a [point-and-click interface](conversation-builder-bot-workspace.html) with a guided assistant that walks users through the creation of automated conversations. And with a library of prebuilt conversation templates for a variety of use cases across multiple industries, you don’t have to start from scratch.

### A flexible bot management tool
Build automated conversation flows once, and run them on every messaging channel. Easily integrate into any back-end system including CRM, scheduling tools, order and inventory management systems, payment platforms, and more.

### Identify and resolve bot failure points with MACS
Our [Meaningful Automated Conversation Score](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/data-reporting-meaningful-automated-conversation-score-(macs).html) (MACS) is the first measurement of how much friction consumers experience in automated conversations. This built-in analysis assesses how well bots are helping with customer queries, highlights common points of failure like poor routing, and helps you quickly move to bot tuning in Conversation Builder.
