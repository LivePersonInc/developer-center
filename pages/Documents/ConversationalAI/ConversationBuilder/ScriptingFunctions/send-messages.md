Use the following built-in functions to send different types of messages to the consumer.

### Send message

`sendMessage` is used to send a single message to user. Using this function we can send messages to the user at any place of the code, without stopping the message flow.

{: .important}
To send multiple messages use the [sendMessages()](#send-messages) function.

| Function Name | Arguments | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sendMessage(message)` | message (string) | None |

#### Example

```javascript
if(count > 10){
    botContext.sendMessage('Looks like you have a lot!');
}else{
    botContext.sendMessage('You could use a few more, for sure!');
}
```

### Send messages

`sendMessages` is used to send an array of the messages to the user. In most cases we use message delay for the send messages function.

{: .important}
[See here](conversation-builder-conversation-builder-interactions.html#limitations) for limitations on types of text that you can send.

{: .important}
To send a single message use the [sendMessage()](#send-message) function.

| Function Name | Arguments | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sendMessages(messages)` | array | None |

#### Example
```javascript
botContext.setMessageDelay(2500);
botContext.sendMessages(['Your current cash rewards balance is $37.50.' , 'If you had been using our AcmeBank Exclusive Cash Rewards Card your current rewards balance would have been $103.50.']);
```

### Send message with quick reply

`sendMessageWithQuickReplies` is used for programatically creating a message containing quick reply buttons. Quick replies have both a title (sauce name) and an optional payload (sauce number).

{: .important}
A few limitations apply to quick replies. You can have up to 10 quick replies per message. The quick reply titles have a character limit of 20 chars. The quick reply payload (delimited by `~`) is optional.

| Function Name | Arguments | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sendMessageWithQuickReplies()` | a message with quick reply buttons. | None |

#### Example

In the example below, we create a message to select your favorite dipping sauce. The sauces are added as an array to create the quick reply buttons.

```javascript
// Create a message with Quick Replies
botContext.sendMessageWithQuickReplies('What is your favorite type of dipping sauce?', ['Ranch~sauce01','Honey Mustard~sauce02','BBQ~sauce03','Hot~sauce04']);
```

### Send immediate reply

`sendImmediateReply` delivers a message to the user immediately and stops the message flow and any other subsequent code within this message.

{: .important}
[See here](conversation-builder-conversation-builder-interactions.html#limitations) for limitations on types of text that you can send.

| Function Name | Arguments | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sendImmediateReply(message)` | message – (string or array) – A string to be added to output. Or an array of strings, each to be added to output in succession. | None |

#### Example

In the below example, the response variables gets what user just said and sends Immediate Reply to the user.

```javascript
var response = botContext.getCurrentUserMessage();
botContext.sendImmediateReply('I think you said, ' + response);
```
