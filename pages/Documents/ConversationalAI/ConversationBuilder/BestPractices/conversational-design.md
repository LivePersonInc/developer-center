For effective bots, follow these best practices for conversational design:

* **Develop a voice**: Create a personality that identifies with your brand and that consumers can connect with.
* **Identify as a bot**: Be transparent by using terms like "virtual assistant" or "automated assistant."
* **Explain capabilities**: Detail upfront what the bot is able to help with to set consumer expectations.
* **Use contractions**: "I'm" sounds more natural than "I am" and reflects how humans actually speak.
* **Avoid ambiguity**: When a bot doesn't recognize an intent, it's recommended to have a [disambiguation](conversation-builder-dialogs-disambiguation-dialogs.html) response.
* **Short and simple**: Use short dialogue to keep consumers engaged and simple words everyone can understand.
* **Visualization**: Line breaks and separate messages can break up long text; emojis and rich content can help to liven up the conversation.
* **Consider context**: Returning consumers can be greeted differently than when they entered the experience for the first time.
* **Tango**: Allow consumers to be connected with an agent at their request, and when the bot doesn't understand after 2 attempts.
* **Validate intent**: To avoid consumer frustration, the bot should confirm the recognized intent before moving down a flow.
