### Introduction

As you design and implement a bot, you can use the [Preview](conversation-builder-testing-deployment-previewing.html) and [Bot Logs](conversation-builder-testing-deployment-debugging.html) tools, respectively, to preview the conversational experience and to debug issues. These tools assist you with early testing and debugging, so you can verify the conversational flow is working as expected as you build the bot. Notably, the tools don’t require that you deploy an agent connector for the bot because the conversation doesn’t go through Conversational Cloud. The conversation only flows between the tool and the underlying bot server.

In contrast, the **Conversation Tester** tool is designed for testing and debugging after deployment. You can use the tool to:

* Test the end-to-end flow after you have finished building and [deploying a bot](tutorials-guides-getting-started-with-bot-building-deploy-the-bot.html)
* Debug a deployed bot

The Conversation Tester lets you quickly start a conversation and view both the conversation and the debug log side by side.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/ct_main.png" alt="A view of the Conversation Tester, with the debug panel on the left and the conversation preview panel on the right">

With the Conversation Tester, the conversation travels from the Conversational Cloud Web channel, to Conversational Cloud, to the agent connector, to the bot server, and back again. In short, there is end-to-end testing of the entire flow over the Web.

Currently, you can’t use the Conversation Tester to test post-conversation survey bots.

### Prerequisites

To use the Conversation Tester, the entire pipeline for messaging must be in place and ready:

* In Conversational Cloud, there must exist a bot user (an agent) that is assigned a skill.
* In Conversation Builder, the bot must have a deployed agent connector that's assigned to the bot user, and the connector must be online.

### Access the Conversation Tester

You can access the Conversation Tester in two ways:

* From within a custom bot, click <img class="inlineimage" style="width:30px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_3_dot_menu.png" alt="Three-dot icon"> on the menu bar, and select **Conversation Tester**.

    This option is available only when the bot has an agent connector (regardless of its status). When you want to test a specific bot, this method is quicker because it automatically starts a conversation with that bot, routing it to the first, associated skill that is found.

* From the bot dashboard, click **Conversation Tester** on the menu bar in the upper-left corner.

    When you want to perform end-to-end testing (of the engagement, skill, bot agent, and bot), this method is recommended because you'll be starting the conversation by specifying the engagement to use, not the bot to use.

    Access via this method does also allow you to select a skill by bot, or by skill directly.

### Start the conversation

Conversational Cloud routes conversations based on skill, so to start a conversation, you need to specify the skill to which to route it.

If you access the Conversation Tester from within a bot, the tool automatically starts a conversation with that bot, routing it to the first, associated skill that is found.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:500px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/ct_conv_start.png" alt="An example of a conversation in the Message the agent panel on the right">

If you access the Conversation Tester from outside of a bot, you'll need to explicitly select the skill and manually start the conversation.

**To select the skill and start the conversation**

1. Click **New Conversation** in the upper-right corner.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:400px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/ct_selectskill1.png" alt="The New Conversation in the upper-right corner above the Message the agent panel">

2. Select the skill. You do this in one of three ways:

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:400px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/ct_selectskill2.png" alt="The options for selecting the skill">

    * **Select skill**: Select the skill. The skill list displays all the skills available within your organization. If you know the skill name to route to, this one-step method is fastest.

    * **Select skill by bot**: Select the custom bot, then the skill. For a bot to appear in the bot list, it must be deployed and online. Once you select the bot, the skill list is filtered to display only the skills assigned to the associated bot agent user. This two-step method is preferable when you want to route the conversation to a specific bot, but you aren't sure of the skill name.

    * **Select skill by campaign/engagement**: Select the campaign to use. This filters the list of engagements from which you must then select the engagement. The skill tied to the engagement will be used to start the conversation. This method is preferable when you want to perform end-to-end testing of the entire Conversational Cloud configuration: engagement, skill, bot agent, and bot.

3. Click **Start Conversation**.

### Start the debugger

Click the debug icon in the lower-left corner of the messaging panel.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:200px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/ct_debug_conv.png" alt="The Debug icon in the lower-left corner of the messaging panel">

This starts the debugger:

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/ct_debugger_start.png" alt="A view of the debugger and messaging panels side-by-side">

### Use the messaging panel

#### Send messages

Once the conversation is started, you can send messages in the messaging panel to direct the conversational flow. This works much like [Preview](conversation-builder-testing-deployment-previewing.html).

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:500px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/ct_send_msgs.png" alt="An example conversation in the messaging panel">

#### Close the conversation

To close the current conversation, click the icon at the bottom of the messaging panel.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:200px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/ct_close_conv.png" alt="The Close Conversation icon at the bottom of the messaging panel">

#### Reset the bot

To reset the bot, click the icon at the bottom of the messaging panel. This deletes the bot session, so you can start the conversation flow anew.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:200px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/ct_reset_bot.png" alt="Reset Bot at the bottom of the messaging panel">

### Use the debug panel

#### Log debug messages

Keep the **Auto update** setting on if you want to continuously fetch the latest logs based on the conversation.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:600px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/ct_debug_auto_update.png" alt="The Auto Update toggle at the top of the debugging panel">

If you don't need the log, you can turn **Auto update** off, which keeps the connection clean. In this case, you can manually refresh the log by clicking <img class="inlineimage" style="width:30px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_ct_refresh_debug_log.png" alt="The Refresh icon">.

#### Show and hide debug messages

The debug log can become verbose and long, so it can be helpful to show and hide specific types of messages. Click <img class="inlineimage" style="width:30px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_ct_filter_debug_msgs.png" alt="The Filter icon"> and use the available filters to do this.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:400px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/ct_debug_filter.png" alt="The Filter options">

#### Search the debug log

To search the debug log for a partial word, word, or phrase, enter it in the search box that’s provided.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:600px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/ct_debug_log_search.png" alt="Searching the debug log using part of a word">

#### Copy the user ID

In scenarios where you’re troubleshooting an issue in collaboration with LivePerson Support, you might be asked to provide the user ID for the conversation. There are two ways you can obtain the ID:

* Click the **Copy user ID** button that’s displayed in the messaging window when you start the debugger.
* Click the **Copy user ID** icon at the bottom of the debugging panel. This too is displayed once you start the debugger.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/ct_copy_user_id.png" alt="The Copy user ID button in the messaging panel and the Copy user ID icon at the bottom of the debugging panel">

### Print the most recent user message

To aid in debugging, you can use the [printDebugMessage](conversation-builder-scripting-functions-log-debug.html#print-debug-message) scripting function in the code areas of an interaction to print messages — for example, the consumer's most recent message — to the debug log.
