### Whitelisting LivePerson services

If you have [IP restrictions](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/security-regulations-security-ip-restriction.html) in place, you’ll need to do some whitelisting so that Conversation Builder can make calls to your brand’s systems and vice versa. You can find all details on whitelisting in [this section](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/security-regulations-security-configuring-your-firewall.html) in the Knowledge Center.

### Whitelisting rich media and web links

* You must whitelist the domains in all URLs for images, videos, and audio files used in interactions. Contact LivePerson Support to assist with this.
* For Facebook, the owner of the Facebook page must whitelist the domains (shortened or otherwise) in all web link URLs, including button links, within the Facebook page settings.
