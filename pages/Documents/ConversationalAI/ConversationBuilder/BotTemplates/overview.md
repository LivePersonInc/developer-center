All Conversation Builder bots are based on **templates**.

The Custom Bot template is the best choice if you want to create a completely custom bot from scratch.

For other, more common use cases, Conversation Builder has a set of predefined, industry vertical templates that enable rapid adoption of automation. Each conversational template consists of the following capabilities:

* Intents associated with the use case

* Conversational dialogs with appropriate interactions for the respective channels or end points (Web, Apple Messages for Business, SMS, etc.)

* API integrations with industry-leading services (e.g., Shopify in Retail) and brand-specific services

### Create a bot from a template

1. From the dashboard that lists your bots, click **New Bot** in the upper-right corner.

2. Select the template.

3. Review what the template includes (dialogs, intents/entities, integrations, etc.), and click **Create Bot**.

4. Configure the parts that need to be customized (API integration details, brand voice in dialog interactions, etc.).
