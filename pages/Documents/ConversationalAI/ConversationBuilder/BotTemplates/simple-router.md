The Simple Router template provides an easy framework for the creation of a routing bot.

### Included items

#### Dialogs

- Welcome
  - Presents the multiple choice interaction to the customer. Each multiple choice response represents a skill.
- Reprompt
  - The multiple choice interaction responses can be clicked or the customer can also type an answer. In the event that the bot does not understand the customer's response, this dialog will reprompt the welcome dialog.
- No Agents Available
  - In the event that the customer could not be transferred to a skill, this dialog will trigger.
- Escalation
  - When a user answers the Welcome dialog's multiple choice, this dialog will trigger and begin the transfer process.

#### Integrations

- Escalation
  - This integration posts a configuration payload to a LivePerson hosted service that will route the customer to a different skill.
  - In the Integrations area, there should be a pre-configured integration named “Transfer” and “LivePerson Agent Escalation” should be selected in the Integration Type menu.

  - The “skillName”, “skillId” and “transferMessage” variables will be populated via our Global Function. You do not need to change anything here.

### Configuration needed

To customize this template, you will need to do the following.

#### Welcome dialog

In the Welcome dialog, in the Dialog Starter interaction, click the defined "hi" patterns. In the Interaction Settings, edit the patterns.

In the Multiple Choice interaction, edit each option text for your skills. Then edit the custom rules for the new skills. You will need to edit the Conditions patterns **and** and intent variable value for each. Of course, you should add or remove rules depending on how many skills you plan to route to.

#### Reprompt dialog

Customize the text response to match your brand voice.

#### No Agents Available dialog

Customize the text response to match your brand voice.

#### Global Functions

The last thing to do is customize some important variables in the Global Functions.

When you click **Global Functions** at the top of Conversation Builder, you should see a block of code. Within this block of code, there is a `switch` statement:

```javascript
switch(intent){
    case "faq":
      transferMessage = "Let's checkout the FAQ bot!";
      skillId = '1678104230';
      skillName = intent;
      break;
    case "simple lead gen":
      transferMessage = "Let's checkout the Simple Lead Gen bot!";
      skillId = '1678105630';
      skillName = intent;
      break;
    case "full lead gen":
      transferMessage = "Let's checkout the Full Lead Gen bot!";
      skillId = '1678104930';
      skillName = intent;
      break;
      case "order status":
      transferMessage = "Let's checkout the Order Status bot!";
      skillId = '1678107030';
      skillName = intent;
      break;
    default:
      transferMessage = "Hold on while I transfer you to someone who can help with your issue…";
      skillId = '1680373730';
      skillName = 'help';
      break;  
  }      
```

For each of your skill options:

- Edit the `case` to match the [intent variable values](#welcome-dialog) of your skill names.

- Edit the `transferMessage` to match the name of your skills.

- Edit the `skillId` to match that of your skills. The skill ID is displayed in the URL in Conversational Cloud when you click on an individual skill.

- The `skillName` is being set to the name of the intent, but if you want to customize it you can.

You might add or remove `case` branches as needed for the number of your skills.

#### Deploy Your Bot

To connect your bot to Conversational Cloud, follow [the instructions](conversation-builder-testing-deployment-deploying-to-conversational-cloud.html). You can also try the [Deploy the Bot tutorial](tutorials-guides-getting-started-with-bot-building-deploy-the-bot.html).

Now you can test your routing bot and see how it routes to your skills.
