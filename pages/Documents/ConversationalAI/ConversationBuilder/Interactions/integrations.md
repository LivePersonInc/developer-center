Integration interactions make programmatic calls to retrieve or post data to external systems and/or to perform actions. They perform their work and then execute the next action.

If an integration retrieves data, that data can be stored in custom fields, so you can use it in subsequent interactions. For information on how to display variable data in interactions, see [here](conversation-builder-interactions-interaction-basics.html#display-variables-in-interactions).

Integrations are similar to questions in that you can define conditions that each perform different next actions (based on which condition is met). Common uses for this include checking whether the integration call was a success or failure, having a condition triggered by the value of an API response, and having these events direct the flow of the conversation in a desired manner.

### Integration interactions

{: .important}
Before you can add an Integration interaction, you need to create the integration itself. For details on this, see [here](conversation-builder-integrations-integration-basics.html#integration-types).

**To add an Integration interaction**

1. Select the interaction just above where you want to add the integration, and click <img style="width:30px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_integration.png"> (Integration) on the interactions toolbar.
2. In the interaction, select the name of the integration to invoke.

    <img style="width:550px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/integrations_api.png">

3. Finish configuring the interaction as desired, and click **Save**.

#### Order of invocation

When an integration interaction is processed, the order of invocation is as follows:

1. Pre-process code
2. Integration call, e.g., API call
3. Post-process code
4. Next action

#### Defining rules based on the result of the API integration

{: .important}
It's recommended that you take advantage of the ability to define rules based on the *result* of the API integration.

In our example below, we've added a rule that checks for a "success" result, and we've configured the next step to continue to the next interaction...

 <img style="width:700px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/integrations_api_rule1.png">

...so, if our "Balance" integration succeeds, the user's balance is displayed (and then the interaction ends). We've likewise added a second rule that checks for a "failure" result, and then we've configured the next step to continue to a "fail" interaction. In this case, if our "Balance" integration fails, the user is notified that something went wrong.

### Agent Transfer interactions

Use an Agent Transfer interaction in a dialog when you want to transfer a conversation from a bot to a live agent, or from a bot in one bot group to a bot in a *different* group.

For some practice with this interaction type, complete the [Connect to Conversational Cloud tutorial](conversation-builder-tutorials-guides-getting-started.html).

{: .important}
There are two ways to implement a transfer: You can add an Agent Transfer interaction, *as discussed here*. Or, you can add an Integration interaction that uses a supporting [LivePerson Agent Escalation integration](conversation-builder-integrations-liveperson-agent-escalation-integrations.html). There is no difference between the two approaches when it comes to performance. However, use of the Agent Transfer interaction is a simpler, more convenient approach because you specify all necessary information in the interaction itself. If you use an Agent Transfer interaction, you *don't* need to create a supporting integration.

{: .important}
Implementing a bot-to-bot transfer? See [here](conversation-builder-bots-bot-to-bot-transfers.html#manual-transfers) for more information.

#### Add an Agent Transfer interaction

**To add an Agent Transfer interaction**

1. Select the interaction just above where you want to add the transfer, and click <img style="width:30px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_agentTransfer.png"> (Agent Transfer) on the interactions toolbar.
2. In the interaction, enter the message to send to the user prior to being transferred, something like, “Hold on while I connect you with an agent.” You can enter either static text, use a variable, or a combination of both. If you need to insert a new line, use an escape character like so: \\\n. 

    This field is required, so if you don't want to send a message, enter "BLANK_MESSAGE" here. That satisfies the underlying, system requirement for a message, but it doesn't actually send one. The default value is, "Transferring to an agent..."

    <img style="width:600px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/interactions_agentTransfer.png">

3. In the upper-right corner of the interaction, click <img style="width:20px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_settings.png"> (Settings icon).
4. Select the **Advanced** tab, and specify the following:

    * **Agent Id**: Optional. Used for bot-to-human transfers only. Specify the ID of the human agent to which to transfer the conversation. (You can obtain the ID from the address bar when the user profile is displayed in Conversational Cloud.) Transfer of the conversation to this agent ID only occurs if the agent is assigned to the skill ID that you specify and is available; otherwise, transfer to the skill ID occurs instead.
    
    * **Agent Skill ID**: Specify the ID of the skill to which to transfer the conversation. The skill is defined in Conversational Cloud. Here you can specify the ID using a bot context variable like `{$botContext.skillId}`, or you can enter a direct, numeric value.

        When the transfer is attempted, the Agent Skill Id is evaluated; if it isn't numeric, the fallback message is sent to the user. If the value is numeric, but the bot doesn't respond for more than 3 minutes (e.g., the chat server becomes overloaded and drops the message), an attempt is made to transfer to the fallback skill ID *if one is specified in the [agent connector](conversation-builder-testing-deployment-deploying-to-conversational-cloud.html#add-an-agent-connector)*. Otherwise, the transfer fails. For information on handling failures, see below.

    * **Transfer Bot Context**: Used for [manual, bot-to-bot transfers](conversation-builder-bots-bot-to-bot-transfers.html#manual-transfers) only. Select this to *automatically* pass the user's intent and/or message from the sender bot to the receiver bot. This lets the receiver bot know the appropriate dialog to start after the transfer.

4. Click **Save**.

{: .important}
If, given your use case, you need to prevent context switching from occurring during the transfer (e.g., messages are sent after the transfer that shouldn't be), you can do this as described [here](conversation-builder-dialogs-dialog-basics.html#preventing-context-switching).

#### Best practices

##### Send a transfer message

When transferring the consumer to a live agent, it's customary to send some form of message to the user like, "Hold on while I connect you with an agent" (see step 2 above). You might want to send this as a Text statement in the dialog. However, supplying the message as a part of the interaction's configuration guarantees the message is the last one seen by the consumer prior to the transfer (because the message is sent as a part of the post body in the underlying Transfer API).

In the interaction, you don't have to supply a message, but if you don't, you'll need to set the field to `BLANK_MESSAGE` to satisfy the system requirement for a value.

##### Add a time delay to the transfer if needed

If you're sending one or more text responses prior to the transfer, it's recommended that you add to the Agent Transfer interaction an interaction delay that accounts for each response you need to send. This gives the bot sufficient time to send the messages before transferring the conversation. For example, if you're sending 3 text messages prior to the transfer, you might add a 6000 millisecond delay to the Agent Transfer interaction (3 messages x 2000 millisecond delay per message = an aggregate 6000 millisecond delay). Specify the delay in the **Interaction Delay** field in the Agent Transfer interaction's settings.

##### Handle transfer failures

Most often in Chat, but occasionally with Messaging, an attempt at transferring to a skill will fail. When this happens, the platform sends the message `__agent_escalation_failed__` to the bot. If you don’t have a dialog set up to catch this pattern, the bot will treat it like any other consumer message. In most cases, it will go to the Fallback dialog.

Setting up a dialog to catch the `__agent_escalation_failed__` pattern allows you to send an appropriate message to the consumer, e.g., "Sorry, we're unable to perform the transfer at this time. Please try again later."

If the `__agent_escalation_failed__` message is sent 3 times to the bot, and the 4th attempt also fails, the escalation stops, and the following default response is sent to the consumer, "Not able to transfer to Agent at this time. Please try later." Alternatively, if you've specified a "default user-friendly response" (for when errors and exceptions occur) in [Bot Settings](conversation-builder-bots-bot-basics.html#configure-bot-settings), that response is sent instead.

### File Upload interactions

{: .important}
File Upload interactions are available for Web Messaging, Apple Messages for Business, and WhatsApp Business. Additionally, the interactions are only available on the LivePerson cloud platform.

Use a File Upload interaction in a dialog when you need the consumer to upload a file that you require. For example, you might have a bot that handles account creation, where the consumer needs to provide an ID card and a document demonstrating proof of a good credit score.

When you use a File Upload interaction, on the consumer side in the messaging window, the consumer can upload the file by dragging and dropping it onto the window. (For an overview of file sharing in Conversational Cloud, see [here](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/messaging-channels-rich-messaging-agent-file-sharing-overview.html).)

{: .important}
Some setup of your Conversational Cloud environment is required before using this feature. Please contact your LivePerson account representative to enable this feature.

**To add a File Upload interaction**

1. Select the interaction just above where you want to add the File Upload interaction, and click <img style="width:30px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_fileUpload.png"> (File Upload) on the interactions toolbar.
2. In the File Upload interaction, enter the message to send to the consumer.

    <img style="width:600px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/integrations_fileUpload2.png">

    For the file to be uploaded, in step 4, you'll follow this with an integration interaction that invokes a File integration.

3. In the File Upload interaction, in the upper-right corner click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_settings.png"> (Settings icon). Select the **Advanced** tab. Then specify the following under **File Upload Settings**:
    - **Accepted File Types**: Select the types of files that you will accept for upload (PDF, JPEG, PNG, DOCx, etc.). If the consumer attempts to upload a file of any other type, the upload will fail, and the Validation Failure message (below) will be sent to the consumer.
    - **Success message**: Enter the message to send to the consumer if the file upload to your external file share is successful. The default value is, "Successfully processed the file."
    - **Failure message**: Enter the message to send to the consumer if the file upload to your external file share is unsuccessful due to an error. The default value is, "Failed to process the file. Please try again."
    - **Validation Failure message**: Enter the message to send to the consumer if the upload fails because the consumer has attempted to upload a file of an invalid type. If you don't supply a message, the following message is sent, "The file type is invalid. Upload one of these types: {a}, {b}, {c}." To help to avoid validation failures, consider mentioning the acceptable file types in the File Upload message, as we've done in the image above.
    - **In progress message**: Enter the message to send to the consumer when the upload begins. The default value is, "Processing the file..."

4. Immediately after the File Upload interaction, add an Integration interaction ( <img style="width:30px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_integration.png"> ). In the interaction, select the File integration to invoke (Integration type = File).
    
    <img style="width:600px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/integrations_fileUpload4.png">

    The File integration handles upload of the file from Conversational Cloud to your brand's external file share. If you haven't already done so, [create the File integration](conversation-builder-integrations-file-integrations.html) now, so you can complete this step.

5. Finish configuring the interactions and overall dialog as per your requirements. For information on potential customization points, see the customization section farther below.

#### Notes on File Upload interactions

- The uploaded file can’t be over 5 MB.
- File upload is an asynchronous process, so the bot's conversation with the consumer will continue while the upload is in progress. The consumer will only be advised of success or failure, respectively, once the process is completed or has failed.
- The File Upload interaction can't be tested using the Preview window.

#### Customization points

##### Uploading multiple files

If the dialog flow requires that the consumer upload *multiple* files, you'll need to add a File Upload interaction for every file, and each interaction must be followed by an Integration interaction. You can certainly reuse the [File integration](conversation-builder-integrations-file-integrations.html) that gets called, as we've done below.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:600px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/integrations_fileUpload3.png">

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:600px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/integrations_fileUpload9.png">

##### Routing the conversation based on success or failure

If desired, you can route the conversation to a different dialog flow *based on whether the upload succeeded or failed*.

To do this for the success flow, create a dialog that begins with a Dialog Starter interaction that matches the pattern `file_upload_success:{your success message}`, for example:

`file_upload_success:Receipt of file is successful`

*Spaces in the message are permitted.*

Then build out the success dialog flow as desired.

You can create a failure dialog similarly. In this case, the Dialog Starter interaction must match the pattern: `file_upload_failed:{your failure message}`.

If your original dialog involves *multiple* uploads--with different success and failure messages for each upload--but you want to handle the uploads with a *single* success dialog (or failure dialog), use the * wildcard character to match all messages like this:

`file_upload_success:*`
