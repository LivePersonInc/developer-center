Statement interactions simply display information and then execute the next action. They don’t expect or wait for a user response.

{: .important}
For information on which statement interactions are supported in which channels, see [here](conversation-builder-interactions-interaction-support.html).

### Text
Text statements display the text provided, for example:

<img style="width:300px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/statements_text.png">

Text statements can display dynamic values through the use of variables; for help with using variables, see [here](conversation-builder-interactions-interaction-basics.html#display-variables-in-interactions).

### Image

{: .important}
For information on which channels support image statements, see [here](conversation-builder-interactions-interaction-support.html).

Image statements display a single image.

#### Image settings

| Setting | Description | Required or Optional | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Image URL | The URL for the image file. The URL must start with HTTP or HTTPS and use a valid format, be a bot environment variable, be a bot context variable, or be a combination thereof.<br><br>When specifying a URL, the domain in the URL must be [whitelisted](conversation-builder-networking-security.html#whitelisting-rich-media).<br><br>Keep images fairly small in size \(MB\) and dimension, so they load quickly. | Required | https://www\.mysite\.com/images/bikes\.jpg |

### Audio
Audio statements currently aren't supported by Conversational Cloud.

### Video
Video statements currently aren't supported by Conversational Cloud. As an alternative, use a Text statement that includes the video URL as a link.

### Apple Rich Links
**For Apple Messages for Business only.**

{: .important}
Use of Apple rich links for video is not supported at this time.

If your business uses Apple’s Messages for Business service to chat with consumers via the Messages app, you can use this type of interaction to send a richer, more interactive and structured message, for example:

<img style="width:450px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/statements_richLink.png">

Apple rich links let consumers directly preview an inline image or video. If you were to use a plain URL for an inline image or video sent through Apple Messages for Business, the consumer would have to tap the “Tap to Load” message to load the content. But with an Apple rich link, the content is displayed directly. (The interaction has been developed per Apple's Rich Link specifications, which you can find [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/businesschatapi/messages_sent/sending_rich_link_messages).)

#### Rich Link settings

{: .important}
Use of Apple rich links for video is not supported at this time.

Consider using a complementary image or one from the video itself. <br><br>The domain in the URL must be [whitelisted](conversation-builder-networking-security.html#whitelisting-rich-media).<br><br>Keep images fairly small in size \(MB\) and dimension, so they load quickly. | Required | https://www\.mysite\.com/images/myImage\.jpg |
| ADD IMAGE OR VIDEO > URL | For an image, this is the item/business URL to load when the image is clicked. For a video, this is the URL for the video file to play when clicked. | Required | https://www\.mysite\.com/videos/myVideo\.mp4 |
| Title | The title of the rich link. | Required | Flower arranging 101 |

#### Populating an Apple Rich Link dynamically

You can populate the statement with static information, or it can be populated dynamically during run time, for example, using data received from an [API integration](conversation-builder-integrations-api-integrations.html).

#### Notes on Apple Rich Links
- While Conversational Cloud supports formatting in Apple rich links, Conversation Builder currently doesn't.
