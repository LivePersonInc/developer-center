After you’ve added a knowledge base and finalized its content, you can expose its articles to consumers or agents as desired.

### Sending content to consumers

In Conversation Builder, add a [Knowledge AI interaction](conversation-builder-interactions-integrations.html#knowledge-ai-interactions) within a bot.

A common use case for a Knowledge AI interaction is within a [Fallback dialog](conversation-builder-dialogs-fallback-dialogs.html), where you want to direct a consumer utterance that didn’t match a dialog starter into a knowledge base search. If an appropriate search result is found, it can be displayed. If no result is found, you might then display a "sorry" message or transfer the conversation to a human agent.

Alternatively, you might have an FAQ dialog or bot that is driven by a knowledge base full of articles. For an example use case that takes advantage of meta intents to capture all FAQ questions, check out [this tutorial](tutorials-guides-bot-groups-other-techniques-meta-intents-knowledge-bases.html).

### Sending content to agents

Save agents time by offering articles as recommended answers to consumer questions. To do this, add a Knowledge Base integration within [Conversation Assist](conversation-assist-overview.html).
