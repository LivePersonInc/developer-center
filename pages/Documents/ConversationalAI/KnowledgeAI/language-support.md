When you create an internal or external knowledge base, you specify its language:

<img class="fancyimage" alt="Specify knowledge base language" style="width:700px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/kai_kblanguage.png">

As mentioned elsewhere (see [here](knowledgeai-internal-knowledge-bases-knowledge-bases.html#add-an-internal-knowledge-base) for an example), make an accurate selection. This helps text-based searches to work as expected and will help with regard to future enhancements related to text-based searches.

{: .note}
In general, keep things consistent across integrations. The language of the knowledge base should be the same as the language of the bot in which the knowledge base is used.

You can select any of the following for the knowledge base’s language:

* Arabic
* Chinese (Cantonese) — Hong Kong
* Chinese (Simplified) — China
* Chinese (Traditional) — Taiwan
* Danish
* Dutch — Netherlands
* English
