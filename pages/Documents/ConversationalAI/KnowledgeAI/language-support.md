### Specifying a language

When you create an internal or external knowledge base, you specify its language:

<img class="fancyimage" alt="Specify knowledge base language" style="width:700px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/kai_kblanguage.png">

As mentioned elsewhere ([example](knowledgeai-internal-knowledge-bases-knowledge-bases.html#add-an-internal-knowledge-base)), make an accurate selection. This helps text-based searches to work as expected and will help with regard to future enhancements related to text-based searches.

{: .important}
In general, keep things consistent across integrations. The language of the knowledge base should be the same as the language of the bot in which the knowledge base is used.

You can select any of the following for the knowledge base’s language:

* Arabic
* Chinese (Cantonese) — Hong Kong
* Chinese (Simplified) — China
* Chinese (Traditional) — Taiwan
* Danish
* Dutch — Netherlands
* English
* English — Australia
* English — Canada
* English — Great Britain
* English — India
* English — United States
* French

* French — France
* German — Germany

### Working with special language characters

If you need to support special language characters (e.g., ö, ü, ß), and you’re creating an [internal knowledge base](knowledgeai-internal-knowledge-bases-introduction.html) by importing a CSV file, ensure the import file is saved as a UTF-8 encoded CSV file beforehand.
