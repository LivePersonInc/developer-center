### Overview

The following documentation outlines the configuration for the connector and how to implement functions specifically for
`Google Dialogflow ES`, also known as `Google Dialogflow Essentials`

### Configuration

{: .note}
See the [Getting Started](third-party-bots-getting-started.html) guide first to complete pre-requisite steps.

You will be presented with following screen to complete the Vendor Settings if you select Dialogflow ES.

{: .note}
Dialogflow ES adheres to Google’s oAuth2. Some degree of familiarity with Google IAM policies and IAM console is
necessary for setting up a valid Dialogflow ES client with _Read Only API access_.
Follow the Dialogflow ES documentation available [here](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/quick/setup#sa-create)
in order to set up the necessary **Service Account**

While creating the service account a JSON file can be retrieved, containing most of the necessary parameters.

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "[PROJECT-ID]",
  "private_key_id": "[KEY-ID]",
  "private_key": "[PRIVATE-KEY]",
  "client_email": "[SERVICE-ACCOUNT-EMAIL]",
  "client_id": "[CLIENT-ID]",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "Client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/[SERVICE-ACCOUNT-EMAIL]"
}
```

Figure 1.2 Private key JSON generated during the Service Account setup

{: .alert}
The config wizard expects each of the pieces of auth data to be copied from the JSON file, without quotes.
For the private_key especially, do not modify the string, do not remove any of the newline characters.

{: .note}
You have to acknowledge the Data Disclaimer in order to use Third-Party Bots.

To validate the credentials provided, you can now perform a connection test to see if the configuration you have provided
is working and the bot is reachable. You will be able to proceed in any case, but only if **Test Connection** will result in
**Connection Successful** the bot is expected to later start successfully.

### Limitations

{: .note}
Dialogflow ES has a [limitation on the length of the text it can process](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/reference/rest/v2/QueryInput#TextInput).
Any query longer than 256 characters will cause Third-Party Bots to invoke a custom event in Dialogflow.
To handle this gracefully, we recommend building a simple intent that handles a **DIALOGFLOW_CHAR_LIMIT** event.

Figure 1.3 Create an intent with an event using the string: DIALOGFLOW_CHAR_LIMIT

Figure 1.4 Add a custom response in the **Text response** section.
