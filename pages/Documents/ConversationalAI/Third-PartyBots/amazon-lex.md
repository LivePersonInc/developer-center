### Overview

The following documentation outlines the configuration for the connector and how to implement functions specifically for **Amazon Lex**.

{: .important}
At this time, Lex response cards & audio messages are not supported.
The Connector uses Lex ApiVersion 2016-11-28.

### Bot Configuration

{: .important}
See the [Getting Started](bot-connectors-getting-started.html) guide before using this document to complete pre-requisite steps.

You will be presented with following screen to complete the Vendor Settings in order to add bot connector.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:600px" src="img/lex/vendor.png">

Figure 1.1 Showing the configuration that needed to be filled

The following Amazon Lex information should be provided to LivePerson:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>

</table>

**NOTE**: Lex APIs adhere to [Signature V4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) Signing Process.
Some degree of familiarity with AWS IAM policies and the AWS IAM console is necessary for setting up a valid Lex client with _Read Only API Key access_.
A _service account_ is a **prerequisite** for setting up the above config. Documentation available [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/index.html).

{: .important}
You have to agree to Data Disclaimer from now onward in order to use the services of bot connector. For that you can click on the checkbox "I agree to the Data Disclaimer"

For validation of the credentials provided, you can now perform a test connection request to see if everything that you have provided is working and reachable. You can click on the button "Test Connection" to see if connection succeed or fail as shown in Figure 1.2 and 1.3 respectively.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:600px" src="img/lex/connection-success.png">

Figure 1.3 Showing the fail case of the invalid credentials

Once you are done with providing configuration you can save it by pressing on "Done". **_Congratulations!_** You have completed the configuration of the Amazon Lex bot.

{: .important}
Following guide is going to introduce how to implement functions specifically for **Amazon Lex** using Amazon Console. Continue if you are familiar and have access to Amazon Console.

### Welcome Event

The behavior of the welcome event is different depending on whether the bot is for chat and messaging. This divergence comes down to the way that each individual LivePerson product works.

A Messaging conversation qualifies as "initiated" from a Conversational Cloud perspective only after the consumer sends their first message. The consumer is prompted for their initial message in the channel they have chosen to initiate the conversation. As a result, the consumer’s first message is something that can be parsed by Lex and an intent determined.

The below documents cover where to configure the initial message on a given platform.

<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Platform</th>
    <th>Docs</th>
    <th>Attribute</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>iOS</td>
    <td>https://developers.liveperson.com/consumer-experience-ios-sdk-localizationkeys.html</td>
    <td>hiMessage</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Android</td>
    <td>https://developers.liveperson.com/android-modifying-string.html#resultOverlayRecordTemplate</td>
    <td>lp_first_message</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Web</td>
    <td>N/A</td>
    <td>Default LP Message</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Other</td>
    <td>N/A</td>
    <td>N/A</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

A Chat conversation is considered started when the chat is routed to an agent. Best practice is for the agent to provide the first response.
In this scenario, there is no text from the consumer to parse, thus the default ‘WELCOME’ event is utilised as a start point for the bot to prompt the user to provide input and progress the conversation.

Ensure you have an ‘entry point’ intent that utilises the default ‘WELCOME-INTENT’ event.

Fig 1.1

### Change Time To Response of Conversation

Change the TTR of a conversation based on the **action** value in the response object.

LivePerson Messaging uses 4 different types of priorities:
"URGENT",
“NORMAL”
“PRIORITIZED”
“CUSTOM”

Only the “CUSTOM” can set a value. The unit of the value is second. And the value of the others are defined in the Agent Workspace.

```json
{
  "type": "ACTION",
  "params": {
    "action": "CHANGE_TTR",
    "data": {
      "ttrType": "URGENT",
      "value": 500
    }
  }
}
```

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:500px" src="img/lex/image_7.png">

Fig 3.1 - Example in Lex console

### Transfer / Escalations

If the bot needs to transfer the conversation to a human agent, or the conversation flow indicates that another bot is better suited for the identified intent, you will need to tell the connector to transfer the conversation to a given skill.

This is achieved using "Custom Markup" in the Response section of a Lex intent.

Multiple scenarios for transfer/escalations exist triggered by the transfer action object.

1. Explicit request from visitor to transfer to an agent (Eg, action : transfer)

2. If the Bot does not have an appropriate answer, it should recognise this as a scenario for a transfer.
   Depending on the connector configuration or the decision making capacity of the bot, the bot will transfer to a particular skill or default skill.

3. If there is a internal error or the bot service cannot be reached the connector will transfer to a default skill set up during configuration.

Transfers and escalations rely on the _action_ item in the response object.

```json
{
  "type": "ACTION",
  "params": {
    "action": "TRANSFER",
    "data": {
      "skill": "bot-transfer-out"
    }
  }
}
```

Fig.4.2 - Example in Lex console

**NOTE**: Additionally, if the Lex error handling "maximum number of retries" is reached the bot connector will also initiate a “default escalation” transfer action.

### Sending Rich Content (Structured Content)

Structured Content/Rich Content is supported by the core LivePerson platform. Documentation for the feature can be found [here](getting-started-with-rich-messaging-introduction.html).

To send structured content via Lex, send a _custom payload_ option via an intent.

{: .important}
If Images are sent in Rich content, then their URLs must be added to a whitelist via internal LivePerson configuration (Houston: `messaging.rich.content.valid.urls`). Please note that you must add all possible domains to this list manually as wildcards are not supported. Moreover, All domains must be HTTPS secure.

```json
{
  "metadata": [
    {
      "type": "ExternalId",
      "id": "ABCD1234"
    }
  ],
  "structuredContent": {
    "type": "vertical",
    "elements": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "product name (Title)",
        "tooltip": "text tooltip",
        "style": {
          "bold": true,
          "size": "large"
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "map",
        "lo": 64.128597,
        "la": -21.89611,
        "tooltip": "map tooltip"
      },
      {
        "type": "button",
        "tooltip": "button tooltip",
        "title": "Navigate",
        "click": {
          "actions": [
            {
              "type": "publishText",
              "text": "my text"
            },
            {
              "type": "navigate",
              "name": "Navigate to store via image",
              "lo": 23423423,
              "la": 2423423423
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Figure 5.1 Lex Example Rich Content Payload

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:500px" src="img/lex/image_10.png">

Fig.5.2 - Example in Lex console

This should contain valid structured content, along with any optional metadata required for the structured content (as seen in Figure 5.1). Always validate your structured content using [this tool](https://livepersoninc.github.io/json-pollock/editor/) before entering into the Lex console.

**NOTE:** Lex supports 1000 characters per custom payload. Structured content will need to be broken down into smaller individual responses smaller if the payload is large.

### Sending Quick Replies (Structured Content)

{: .important}
**Please note** Quick Replies are only supported in Messaging Conversations.

Quick Replies is a special type of Structured Content. It is a message sent along with predefined answers.
For detailed information on Quick Replies check out the documentation for the specific channel ([Mobile SDK and Web](mobile-sdk-and-web-templates-quick-replies-template.html), [Facebook Messenger](facebook-messenger-templates-quick-replies-template.html), [Google RCS Business Messaging](google-rcs-business-messaging-templates-quick-replies-template.html)).

```json
{
  "structuredContent": {
    "quickReplies": {
      "type": "quickReplies",
      "itemsPerRow": 8,
      "replies": [
        {
          "type": "button",
          "tooltip": "yes i do",
          "title": "yes",
          "click": {
            "actions": [
              {
                "type": "publishText",
                "text": "yep"
              }
            ],
            "metadata": [
              {
                "type": "ExternalId",
                "id": "Yes-1234"
              }
            ]
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "button",
          "tooltip": "No!",
          "title": "No!",
          "click": {
            "actions": [
              {
                "type": "publishText",
                "text": "No!"
              }
            ],
            "metadata": [
              {
                "type": "ExternalId",
                "id": "No-4321"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    "message": "Do you like Bots?"
  },
  "metadata": [
    {
      "id": "1234",
      "type": "ExternalId"
    }
  ]
}
```

Figure 6.1 QuickReplies Structured Content example

### Sending Encoded Metadata

Conversational Cloud Messaging platform provides a new metadata input type (“encodedMetadata”) for passing a base64 encoded metadata on a conversation. The new metadata input type is in addition to the existing [conversation metadata](messaging-agent-sdk-conversation-metadata-guide.html) input field. Third-party Bot also supports this property and this section will cover the information needed for you to send encoded metadata within your conversations. Before sending encoded metadata you must ensure the following conditions in order to successfully send the data.

<ul>
  <li><b>Common.EncodedMetadata</b> AC feature is ON</li>
  <li>Content is base64 encoded</li>
  <li> Metadata size is limited to 5k</li>
</ul>

{: .important}
Failing to comply with the above validation points will cause the message to be dropped. This feature is only available for the messaging conversations not for chat conversations

Encoded Metadata can be sent with simple Text, Rich Content (structured content) and Multiple responses. For sending encoded metadata as a Text or Rich Content message you must use `Custom Markup` type for your relevant intent as shown in Figure 7.1 below

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/lex/lex_encoded_metadata_custom_markup.png">
Figure 7.1

#### Sending Text Message with Encoded Metadata

Please note that the default `Message` option in Lex will not work with encoded metadata feature. You have to use Custom Markup with the properties `textResponse` and `encodedMetadata`. Be careful with the camel-case characters you must provide it exactly the same.

<ul>
  <li> <b>textResponse</b>: This is the text that will be sent to the user.</li>
  <li><b>encodedMetadata</b>: this is the property that will contain encoded metadata</li>
</ul>

An example of the custom payload text message response is below:

```json
{
  "textResponse": "Hello I am a text response with encoded metadata!",
  "encodedMetadata": "ewoic29tZUluZm8iOiAiSSB3YXMgZW5jb2RlZCIKfQ=="
}
```

<br />

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/lex/lex_encoded_metadata_text.png">
Figure 7.2 
 
#### Sending Rich Content (structured content) with Encoded Metadata

You need to add another property of `encodedMetadata` with your rich content object that you have created. An example of the simple Rich Content `JSON` can be seen below:

```json
{
  "metadata": [
    {
      "id": "1234",
      "type": "ExternalId"
    }
  ],
  "encodedMetadata": "ewoic29tZUluZm8iOiAiSSB3YXMgZW5jb2RlZCIKfQ==",
  "structuredContent": {
    "type": "vertical",
    "elements": [
      {
        "type": "button",
        "click": {
          "actions": [
            {
              "text": "Recommend me a movie, please",
              "type": "publishText"
            }
          ]
        },
        "title": "Recommend a movie"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

<br />

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/lex/lex_encoded_metadata_structured_content.png">
Figure 7.3

### Sending Pause/Delay Message

It is possible to send an event of type "delay" before regular content events and actions. This specifies the time the bot will wait before displaying the next message. The delay message can be added via Custom Markup response in intent definition (as shown in Figure 8.1). There are two properties, `delay` and `typing`, which are a part of the Custom Payload response.

<ul>
  <li> <b>delay</b>: This is the number of seconds the bot will wait. These are expected to be only whole numbers for example for one second delay you will write 1 as a value</li>
  <li><b>typing</b>: This property will enable/disable the typing indicator while delay is happening. It is optional; if not provided then the value will be considered as true.</li>
</ul>

<br />

Setting a delay in between multiple messages is possible and an example of such a case (Message - Delay - Message) can be seen in Figure 8.1.

<img class="fancyimage"  src="img/lex/lex_message_delay_message.png">
Figure 8.1 An example of Message - Delay - Message  configuration in the Amazon lex console's intent editor

it is also possible to send only a single delay response. The example payload of such response is below:

```json
{
  "delay": 8,
  "typing": false
}
```

<img class="fancyimage" src="img/lex/delay_response_custom_payload.png">
Figure 8.2 showing the Custom Markup message for delay message

**Note:** using the delay as a single/sole response from the bot to the consumer, is effectively a ‘no response’ action. Using this allows the bot to receive a consumer message without responding to the consumer.

### Sending Private Text Message

It is possible to send a private text message from the Live Engage (LE-UI) via agent workspace. This feature can now be used via the Third-Party bots as well. This will allow Brands to define private message text within the conversational flow of the bot. These messages are published into the conversation for other Agent/Manger participants. This enables Brands to customize messages giving more insight, summarizing actions taken by the bot, or also advising on next actions the handover agent should take.

{: .important}
Please note If you have not migrated to new Agent Workspace you will not be able to see the `Private` message indicator in the conversation window. Nevertheless, private text messages will not be shown to the consumer and only remain visible to Agents and Managers.

Please note private text message will never be shown to the consumer and will be visible only inside the conversation window of agent workspace. The private text message can be added via the Custom Markup response in intent definition (as shown in Figure 9.1). There are two properties, `text` and `messageAudience`.

| key             | value                                 | notes                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| text            | any string value                      | mandatory                 |
| messageAudience | value should be "AGENTS_AND_MANAGERS" | case sensitive, mandatory |

<br />

Setting a private text message between multiple messages is also possible. Moreover, it is also possible to send a private text message with the combination of actions(e.g. Transfer / Escalations) as well. Example of such a case (Message - Private Text Message - Action) can be seen in Figure 9.1.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:600px" src="img/lex/private_message_response_custom_payload.png">
Figure 9.1 An example of transfer action with a simple text message and private text message in the Amazon lex console's intent editor

It is possible to send only a private text message response. The example payload of such response is below:

```json
{
  "messageAudience": "AGENTS_AND_MANAGERS",
  "text": "This is a private message for agent from Lex"
}
```

### Close Chat/Conversation

In the bot’s flow, there will be times when it is appropriate to end the conversation without escalating to a live agent.
If a query has been answered, or the brand has determined that no escalation is required for a given query, then it is best practice to have the bot end the conversation.

The method for closing a conversation is similar to the transfer action in that the same "Actions and Parameters" field is utilised in the Lex console.

The action field needs to be set to **CLOSE_CONVERSATION **to instruct the connector to to close the conversation.

```json
{
  "type": "ACTION",
  "params": {
    "action": "CLOSE_CONVERSATION"
  }
}
```

Figure 10.1 Lex Example Close Conversation Payload

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:500px" src="img/lex/image_11.png">

Figure 10.2 - Example in Lex console

To close the conversation without triggering the post conversation survey use following payload

```json
{
  "type": "ACTION",
  "params": {
    "action": "CLOSE_CONVERSATION",
    "data": {
      "withoutPcs": true
    }
  }
}
```

Figure 10.3 Lex Example Close Conversation without PCS payload


### Invoke LivePerson Function

During a conversation, it is possible to trigger a LivePerson Function that is deployed to the [LivePerson Functions](liveperson-functions-overview.html)  (Function as a Service) platform. This provides a way to run custom logic with a bot.

The action field needs to be set to **INVOCATION** to instruct the connector to invoke the specified LivePerson Function.

It is also required to provide the **lambdaUuid**, of the function that should be invoked, in `data`. 
To retrieve the Lambda UUID of your LivePerson Function follow [this guide](liveperson-functions-external-invocations-client-credentials.html#step-4-get-the-lambda-uuid-from-functions)

In addition, it is possible to send your own payload to the function. Set your content inside the **payload** key.

The bot does not escalate on a failed invocation by default. To enable this, just set an additional parameter **failOnError** to **true**

```json
{
  "type": "ACTION",
  "params": {
    "action": "INVOCATION",
    "data": {
     "lambdaUuid": "4ec49ffc-080b-4e59-b302-18d6b826191b",
      "payload": "{ "some": "stuff"}",
      "failOnError": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Engagement attributes as context

Third-Party bots allows the collection of engagement attributes (more information can be found [here](engagement-attributes-types-of-engagement-attributes.html)) if `Engagement Attributes` option is checked in the `Conversation Type` step as shown in Figure 11.1.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:750px" src="img/engagement_attr_select.png">
Figure 11.1 Conversation Type step in creation/modification of bot configuration.

These attributes are **only** collected at the start of a conversation. Third-Party bots leverage the LivePerson Visit Information API to collect the engagement attributes, Further information Visit Information API can be found [here](visit-information-api-visit-information.html). Engagement attributes are not updated throughout the life cycle of a conversation and only passed along with each message request. For Lex, engagement attributes are added to the property `lpSdes` inside another custom sub-property `BC-LP-CONTEXT`. For the preservation of the state of engagement attributes across conversation `requestAttributes` property is used (more information about `requestAttributes` can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/API_runtime_PostText.html#API_runtime_PostText_RequestSyntax)). An example of the request body can be seen below:

```javascript
{
  "inputText": "",
  "userId": "",
  "sessionAttributes": "",
  "requestAttributes": {
    "BC-LP-CONTEXT": {
      "lpEvent": {}, // Holds LP Events
      "lpSdes": {}
    }
  }
}
```
