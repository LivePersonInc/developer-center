The following documentation outlines the configuration for a bot connector using LivePerson Functions. Instead of a vendor, like IBM Watson for example, LivePerson Functions allows you to write your own custom bot and connect it to Conversational Cloud. In order to achieve this, we will implement a LivePerson Functions **Custom Integration**.

{: .important}
As the Custom Integration feature uses [LivePerson Functions](https://developers.liveperson.com/liveperson-functions-overview.html), it's required to enable `FaaS Admin` permissions. To be able to implement your own LivePerson Functions, you will also need to enable `FaaS Developer` permissions. Take a look at this [Getting Started Guide](function-as-a-service-getting-started.html) for more information on setting uo LivePerson Functions and its permissions.

### Bot Configuration

{: .important}
See the [Getting Started](bot-connectors-getting-started.html) guide first to complete pre-requisite steps. This guide assumes you have completed this guide.

Once you have completed the guide above, you will be presented with following screen to complete the Vendor Settings in order to add a bot.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:600px" src="img/faas/vendor.png">

Click on the "Create LivePerson Function" button. This will allow you to implement a LivePerson Function. Once you click on the button, you will be redirected to the LivePerson Functions main page. From here, you will need to develop and then deploy a LivePerson Function which will act as the bot connector.

#### Step-by-Step function creation and deployment guide

##### Step 1 - Create a function

Create a new function using the **_Third-Party Bots Custom Integration_** event.

##### Step 2 - Edit the Function

Adjust the default code from the function template according to your needs by modifying the function (see below for more information on relevant considerations and code examples). On the right side you can see an example of the payload (in the sidebar, which you might need to open). Please see this document for more information on [developing functions](liveperson-functions-development-overview.html).

##### Step 3 - Deploy the function

Just like any other function, this function must be deployed before it can be used. [Please see this document](function-as-a-service-deploying-functions.html) for more information on how to deploy your function. At this point, you can also test your function.

<div class="important">Try to deploy functions with a runtime of less than one second. If the runtime is longer, you may get a bad user experience because of race conditions within the server. For example, if you create a function based on the <b> Participants Change</b> event and an agent joins the conversation, the consumer may see the resulting `systemMessage` <b>after the agent already responded to the consumer themselves</b>.</div>

#### Last Steps in Third-Party Bots

After you successfully implemented and deployed a LivePerson Function, press the refresh button next to the function selection menu and select your function.

{: .important}
You have to agree to Data Disclaimer in order to use the services of the bot connector. To do that, click on the checkbox "I agree to the Data Disclaimer" checkbox.

For validation of the credentials provided, you can now perform a test connection request to see if everything that you have provided is working and reachable. You can click on the button "Test Connection" to see if connection succeed or fail. If it has suceeded, you're done!

### Payload Information

The following payload content will be recieved from the Function during a conversation with the assigned bot.

<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Property </th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>message</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>message sent by the customer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>event</td>
    <td>Object</td>
    <td>event triggered by the customer (welcome event)</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Welcome Event

The behaviour of the welcome event is different depending on whether the bot is for chat or for messaging. This divergence comes down to the way that each individual LivePerson product works and the conversation with the consumer is framed.

A Messaging interaction qualifies as "initiated" from a Conversational Cloud perspective only after the consumer sends their first message. The consumer is prompted for their initial message in the channel they have chosen to initiate the conversation. As a result, the consumer’s first message is something that can be recognized.

The following documents cover where to configure the initial message on a given platform:

<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Platform</th>
    <th>Docs</th>
    <th>Attribute</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>iOS</td>
    <td>https://developers.liveperson.com/consumer-experience-ios-sdk-localizationkeys.html</td>
    <td>hiMessage</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Android</td>
    <td>https://developers.liveperson.com/android-modifying-string.html#resultOverlayRecordTemplate</td>
    <td>lp_first_message</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

A Chat interaction, on the other hand, is considered "started" when the chat is routed to an agent and best practice is for the agent to provide the first response. In this scenario, there is no text from the consumer to parse, thus the default ‘WELCOME’ event is utilised as a start point for the bot to prompt the user to provide input and progress the conversation.

### Sending intent information

To provide some more information and context alongside the messages to the consumer, you can define intent information via the context property. The defined intent will then be displayed in the Agent Escalation Summary Widget.

| key             | value                  | notes    |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | -------- |
| intentId        | String, max len 256    | Required |
| intentName      | String, max len 256    | Optional |
| confidenceScore | Number between 0 and 1 | Required |

```javascript
const payload = {
  messages: ["Hi i am an intent information example"],
  context: {
    intentId: "intent-info-example",
    intentName: "Intent information example.",
    confidenceScore: 1,
  },
};
```

### Sending messages

To define messages the bot should send, you need to place the messages property into the callback. This property should include an array of messages, every entry of array will be sent as a single message to the conversation.

```javascript
const payload = {
  messages: ["Message one", "Message two", "Message three"],
};
```

### Change Time To Response of Conversation

Change the TTR of a conversation based on the **action** value in the response object. LivePerson uses 4 different types of priorities: "URGENT", “NORMAL”, “PRIORITIZED”. The time values are defined in Conversational Cloud's Agent Workspace. These values determine how much time, in seconds, a conversation can wait in queue before it is deemed "overdue".

Below is an example of an payload, which changes the TTR:

| key     | value                             | notes     |
| ------- | --------------------------------- | --------- |
| action  | CHANGE_TTR                        | Mandatory |
| ttrtype | "URGENT", “NORMAL”, “PRIORITIZED” |

```javascript
const payload = {
  messages: ["This conversation has been marked urgent"],
  context: {
    action: "CHANGE_TTR",
    actionParameters: {
      ttrType: "URGENT",
    },
  },
};
```

### Transfer / Escalations

If the bot needs to transfer the conversation to a human agent, or the conversation flow indicates that another bot is better suited for the identified intent, you will need to instruct the connector to transfer the conversation to a given skill or specific agent.

Transfers and escalations rely on the `action` key in the response object and its value.

| key     | value                                             | notes                         |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| action  | TRANSFER                                          | case sensitive, mandatory     |
| skill   | a skill name which exists in your account account | case sensitive                |
| agentId | id of agent which exists in your account          | optional, premission required |

#### Transfer To Skill

This option transfers the conversation to the next available agent using the provided skill.

Below is an example of what the response JSON from the LivePerson Function should look like to complete a transfer to skill action.

```javascript
const payload = {
  messages: [
    "Please wait will I check if we have any live agents online that can attend to you",
  ],
  context: {
    action: "TRANSFER",
    actionParameters: {
      skill: "bot-escalation",
    },
  },
};
```

#### Transfer to Agent

{: .important}
This feature is depending on [permissions](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/contact-center-management-messaging-operations-transfer-to-agent.html#permissions)

This option transfers the conversation to the particular agent matching the provided agentId and skill. If the agent is not available, the conversation will be transfered to an available agent with the same skill

Below is an example of what the response JSON from the LivePerson Function should look like to complete a transfer to agent action.

```javascript
const payload = {
  messages: ["Please wait will I transfer you to a specific agent"],
  context: {
    action: "TRANSFER",
    actionParameters: {
      skill: "bot-escalation",
      agentId: "4129463410",
    },
  },
};
```

### Invoke LivePerson Function

During a conversation, it is possible to trigger a different LivePerson Function. This provides a way to run additional custom logic with a bot.

To invoke a different LivePerson Function, we use the `action` key in the response object as we did for a transfer (see example above).

| key         | value                                                      | notes                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| action      | INVOCATION                                                 | case sensitive, mandatory |
| lambdaUuid  | lambda UUID of LivePerson Function                         | case sensitive, mandatory |
| payload     | content that will be sent to the LivePerson Function       | case sensitive            |
| failOnError | boolean that decides if bot escalates on failed invocation | case sensitive            |

To retrieve the **_lambdaUuid_** of your LivePerson Function follow [this guide](liveperson-functions-external-invocations-client-credentials.html#step-4-get-the-lambda-uuid-from-functions)

In addition, it is possible to send your own payload to the function. Set your content inside the **payload** parameter.

The bot does not escalate on a failed invocation by default. To enable this, set the additional parameter **failOnError** to **true**.

```javascript
const payload = {
  messages: [
    "Please wait will I check if we have any live agents online that can attend to you",
  ],
  context: {
    action: "INVOCATION",
    actionParameters: {
      "lambdaUuid": "4ec49ffc-080b-4e59-b302-18d6b826191b",
      "payload": "{ "some": "stuff"}",
      "failOnError": true
    },
  },
};
```

### Sending Rich Content (Structured content)

{: .important}
Structured Content will be added into messages property after LivePerson Functions version 2.9 to support multiple structured content messages

Structured Content/Rich Content is supported by the core LivePerson platform. Documentation for the feature can be found [here](getting-started-with-rich-messaging-introduction.html). To send structured content via LivePerson Functions, use the _structuredContent_ property containing valid structured content, along with metadata required for the structured content. Always validate your structured content using [this tool](https://livepersoninc.github.io/json-pollock/editor/) to check your formatting. There are two ways you can send structured content.

{: .important}
If Images are sent in Rich content, then their URLs must be added to a whitelist via internal LivePerson configuration (Houston: `messaging.rich.content.valid.urls`). Please note that you must add all possible domains to this list manually as wildcards are not supported. Moreover, All domains must be HTTPS secure.

#### Sending Structured content via 'messages' property

Structured content can be the part of the `messages` array property and can be sent with other messages (if defined). an example of string message and structure content can be seen below:

```javascript
const payload = {
  messages: [
    "Hi How are you doing?",
    {
      structuredContent: {
        type: "vertical",
        elements: [
          {
            type: "button",
            click: {
              actions: [
                {
                  text: "Recommend me a movie, please",
                  type: "publishText",
                },
              ],
            },
            title: "Recommend a movie",
          },
        ],
      },
      metadata: {
        type: "ExternalId",
        id: "12345",
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

#### Sending (single) Structured content via 'context' property (Legacy)

You can send a single structured content by adding it to `context` variable (Legacy support). Example can be seen below

```javascript
const payload = {
  messages: ["Just some structured Content"],
  context: {
    metadata: [
      {
        type: "ExternalId",
        id: "ABCD1234",
      },
    ],
    structuredContent: {
      type: "vertical",
      elements: [
        {
          type: "image",
          url: "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zmeByDJ02mQ/hqdefault.jpg",
          tooltip: "image tooltip",
        },
        {
          type: "text",
          text: "product name (Title)",
          tooltip: "product name (Title)",
        },
        {
          type: "text",
          text: "product category (type)",
          tooltip: "product category (type)",
        },
        {
          type: "text",
          text: "$155.99",
          tooltip: "$155.99",
        },
      ],
    },
  },
};
```

{: .important}
**Please note** that `messages` defined in array (in above example) are sent first and structured content sent via `context` will be sent as a last message.

### Sending Quick Replies (Structured Content)

{: .important}
**Please note** Quick Replies are only supported in Messaging Conversations.

Quick Replies is a special type of Structured Content. It is a message sent alongside with predefined answers.
For detailed information on Quick Replies check out the documentation for the specific channel: ([Mobile SDK and Web](mobile-sdk-and-web-templates-quick-replies-template.html), [Facebook Messenger](facebook-messenger-templates-quick-replies-template.html), or [Google RCS Business Messaging](google-rcs-business-messaging-templates-quick-replies-template.html)).

```javascript
const payload = {
  messages: [
    {
      structuredContent: {
        // Mandatory, this will be send as text message together with quick replies
        message: "Do you like Bots?",
        quickReplies: {
          type: "quickReplies",
          itemsPerRow: 8,
          replies: [
            {
              type: "button",
              tooltip: "yes i do",
              title: "yes",
              click: {
                actions: [
                  {
                    type: "publishText",
                    text: "yep",
                  },
                ],
                metadata: [
                  {
                    type: "ExternalId",
                    id: "Yes-1234",
                  },
                ],
              },
            },
            {
              type: "button",
              tooltip: "No!",
              title: "No!",
              click: {
                actions: [
                  {
                    type: "publishText",
                    text: "No!",
                  },
                ],
                metadata: [
                  {
                    type: "ExternalId",
                    id: "No-4321",
                  },
                ],
              },
            },
          ],
        },
      },
      metadata: [
        {
          id: "1234",
          type: "ExternalId",
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
};
```

**Please note**: that quick replies can be sent in via `context` and `messages` both ways like any other structured content. for more information check [send rich content section](third-party-bots-custom-integration.html#sending-rich-content-structured-content)

### Sending Pause/Delay Message

It is possible to send an event of type "delay" before regular content events and actions. This specifies the time the bot will wait before displaying the next message. There are two properties, `delay` and `typing`, which need to be added in with the response body of the function.

<ul>
  <li> <b>delay</b>: The number of seconds which the bot will wait. These are expected to be only whole numbers for example for one second delay you will write 1 as a value</li>
  <li><b>typing</b>: This property will enable/disable the typing indicator while delay is happening. It is optional; if not provided then the value will be considered as true</li>
</ul>

Setting a delay in between multiple messages is possible and an example of such a case (Message - Delay - Structured Content) can be seen below:

```javascript
const payload = {
  messages: [
    "Hi i am a message before delay",
    {
      delay: 5,
      typing: true,
    },
    {
      structuredContent: {
        type: "vertical",
        elements: [
          {
            type: "button",
            click: {
              actions: [
                {
                  text: "Recommend me a movie, please",
                  type: "publishText",
                },
              ],
            },
            title: "Recommend a movie",
          },
        ],
      },
      metadata: {
        type: "ExternalId",
        id: "12345",
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

**Note:** using the delay as a single/sole response from the bot to the consumer is effectively a ‘no response’ action. This allows the bot to receive a consumer message without responding to the consumer.

### Sending Private Text Message

It is possible to send a private text message from the Live Engage (LE-UI) via agent workspace. This feature can now be used via the Third-Party bots as well. This will allow Brands to define private message text within the conversational flow of the bot. These messages are published into the conversation for other Agent/Manger participants. This enables Brands to customize messages giving more insight, summarizing actions taken by the bot, or also advising on next actions the handover agent should take.

{: .important}
Please note If you have not migrated to new Agent Workspace you will not be able to see the `Private` message indicator in the conversation window. Nevertheless, private text messages will not be shown to the consumer and only remain visible to Agents and Managers.

Please note private text message will never be shown to the consumer and will be visible only inside the conversation window of agent workspace. There are two properties, `text` and `messageAudience` which need to be added in with the response body of the function.

| key             | value                                 | notes                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| text            | any string value                      | mandatory                 |
| messageAudience | value should be "AGENTS_AND_MANAGERS" | case sensitive, mandatory |

<br />

Setting a private text message between multiple messages (with action) is possible and an example of such a case (Simple Text Message - Private Text Message - Action) can be seen below:

```javascript
const payload = {
  messages: [
    "Transferring",
    {
      text: "This is a private text",
      messageAudience: "AGENTS_AND_MANAGERS",
    },
  ],
  context: {
    action: "TRANSFER",
    actionParameters: { skill: "human_skill" },
  },
};
```

### Close Chat/Conversation

In the bot’s flow, there will be times when it is appropriate to end the conversation with the consumer without escalating to a live agent. If a query has been answered, or the brand has determined that no escalation is available for a given query, then you will need to have the bot end the conversation.

The method for closing a conversation is similar to the transfer action in that the same "Actions and Parameters" field is utilised in the Dialogflow console.

The `action` key needs to be set to **CLOSE_CONVERSATION** to instruct the connector to close the conversation.

Below is an example of what the response JSON from the LivePerson Function should look like in order to complete a `closeConversation` action.

```javascript
const payload = {
  messages: [
    "Unfortunately I am unable to help you with this query. Have a nice day.",
  ],
  context: {
    action: "CLOSE_CONVERSATION", // Close action
  },
};
```

Below is an example of what the response JSON from the LivePerson Function should look like in order to complete a `closeConversation` action without triggering the post conversation survey.

```javascript
const payload = {
  messages: [
    "Unfortunately I am unable to help you with this query. Have a nice day.",
  ],
  context: {
    action: "CLOSE_CONVERSATION",
    actionParameters: {
      withoutPcs: true, // tell the connector not to trigger post conversation survey, instead close entire conversation
    },
  },
};
```

### Engagement attributes as context

Third-Party bots allows the collection of engagement attributes (more information can be found [here](engagement-attributes-types-of-engagement-attributes.html)) if `Engagement Attributes` option is checked in the `Conversation Type` step as shown in Figure below.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:750px" src="img/ThirdPartyBots/common-engagement-attr-select.png">
Figure showing Conversation Type step in creation/modification of bot configuration.

These attributes are **only** collected at the start of a conversation. Third-Party bots leverage the LivePerson Visit Information API to collect the engagement attributes, Further information Visit Information API can be found [here](visit-information-api-visit-information.html). Moreover, Engagement attributes are not updated throughout the life cycle of a conversation and only passed along with each message request. In Custom Bots integration these engagement attributes are added to the property `lpSdes`. For the preservation of these attributes within a conversation `context` property is used. An example of the request body can be seen below:

```javascript
const {
  message,
  convId,
  event: { name: eventName = "" } = {},
  context: {
    lpEvent, // contains the original received raw connector event
    lpSdes: { unauthenticatedSdes, authenticatedSdes }, // contains all collected lpSdes on conversation start if collecting is enabled
  },
} = input.payload;
```

### Sending Encoded Metadata

Conversational Cloud Messaging platform provides a new metadata input type (“encodedMetadata”) for passing a base64 encoded metadata on a conversation. The new metadata input type is in addition to the existing [conversation metadata](messaging-agent-sdk-conversation-metadata-guide.html) input field. Third-party Bot also supports this property and this section will cover the information needed for you to send encoded metadata within your conversations. Before sending encoded metadata you must ensure the following conditions in order to successfully send the data.

<ul>
  <li><b>Common.EncodedMetadata</b> AC feature is ON</li>
  <li>Content is base64 encoded</li>
  <li> Metadata size is limited to 5k</li>
</ul>

{: .important}
Failing to comply with the above validation points will cause the message to be dropped. This feature is only available for the messaging conversations not for chat conversations

Encoded Metadata can be sent with simple Text, Rich Content (structured content) and Multiple responses.

#### Sending Text Message with Encoded Metadata

For sending `encodedMetadata` with the response of your callback this property must be included in the `context` object. Be careful with the camel-case characters you must provide it exactly the same. An example of the simple two text message response is below:

{: .important}
`encodedMetadata` will be supplied to all the messages defined in `messages` property.

```javascript
const payload = {
  context: {
    encodedMetadata: "ewoic29tZUluZm8iOiAiSSB3YXMgZW5jb2RlZCIKfQ==",
  },

#### Sending Rich Content (structured content) with Encoded Metadata

For sending `encodedMetadata` with the response of your callback this property must be included in the `context` object. Be careful with the camel-case characters you must provide it exactly the same. An example of the a simple text message and a rich content response is below:

{: .important}
`encodedMetadata` will be supplied to all the messages defined in `messages` property and also to rich content.

```javascript
const payload = {
  context: {
    encodedMetadata: "ewoic29tZUluZm8iOiAiSSB3YXMgZW5jb2RlZCIKfQ==",
  },
  messages: [
    "I am a text response with encoded metadata",
    {
      structuredContent: {
        type: "vertical",
        elements: [
          {
            type: "button",
            click: {
              actions: [
                {
                  text: "Recommend me a movie, please",
                  type: "publishText",
                },
              ],
            },
            title: "Recommend a movie",
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

If you want to apply `encodedMetadata` specific to a structured content then you can find below example where `encodedMetadata` with value `ZGlmZmVyZW50IGVuY29kZWQgbWV0YWRhdGE=` will be applied to the structured content message only. For the other messages `encodedMetadata` defined in the `context` will be applied.

```javascript
const payload = {
  messages: [
    "Hi How are you doing?",
    {
      encodedMetadata: "ZGlmZmVyZW50IGVuY29kZWQgbWV0YWRhdGE=",
      structuredContent: {
        type: "vertical",
        elements: [
          {
            type: "button",
            click: {
              actions: [
                {
                  text: "Recommend me a movie, please",
                  type: "publishText",
                },
              ],
            },
            title: "Recommend a movie",
          },
        ],
      },
      metadata: {
        type: "ExternalId",
        id: "12345",
      },
    },
  ],
  context: {
    encodedMetadata: "ewoic29tZUluZm8iOiAiSSB3YXMgZW5jb2RlZCIKfQ==",
  },
};
```

#### Sending Social Messages (Public Message) with Social Metadata

```javascript
function lambda(input, callback) {
  // Take a look at this guide to get further information about Social Messaging & Conversation Metadata
  // https://developers.liveperson.com/messaging-agent-sdk-conversation-metadata-guide.html

  const {
    message,
    convId,
    context: { lpEvent: { metadata: umsMetadata = [] } = {} } = {},
  } = input.payload;
  const response = {
    context: {
      metadata: [],
    },
    messages: [],
  };
  const socialMetadata = umsMetadata.find(
    (m) => m.type === "SocialMessagingEventData"
  );

  const addPrivateSMLinkMetadata = () => {
    if (socialMetadata && socialMetadata.channel === "Public") {
      const myMessage =
        "I'm a BOT, please join to our private chat to talk with a live agent:\n https://m.me/" +
        socialMetadata.conversationState.dmChatId;

      // The following is an example of Facebook Public Replies
      const socialMetadataResponse = {
        type: "SocialMessagingEventData",
        channel: "Public",
        replyToId: `${socialMetadata.replyToId}`,
        event: {
          source: "Facebook",
          type: "CC",
        },
        conversationState: {
          currentChannel: "Public",
          dmChatId: `${socialMetadata.conversationState.dmChatId}`,
        },
      };

      // LEGACY
      // See: Sending (single) Structured content via 'context' property (Legacy)
      const structureContentSM = {
        type: "vertical",
        elements: [
          {
            type: "text",
            text: myMessage,
            alt: "sm-piggyback",
          },
        ],
      };
      response.context.structuredContent = structureContentSM;
      response.context.metadata.push(socialMetadataResponse);

      // TRANSFER
      // See: Transfer / Escalations
      response.context.action = "TRANSFER";
      response.context.actionParameters = { skill: "facebook" };
    }
  };

  addPrivateSMLinkMetadata();

  callback(null, response);
}
```

### Receiving Rich Content Response (Messaging Only)

Third-Party Bots allows LivePerson's Rich Messaging channel capabilities not only to be received as a response from the vendor but also, allow Rich Messages
(Structured Content) to be sent back to the vendor based on specific user interactions/responses (For example user sharing their location on WhatsApp).
Please note these capabilities are sometimes limited by the channels in which conversation is happening. For the list of Rich Messaging capabilities for each channel,
browse or search the table on the [Knowledge Center](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/messaging-channels-messaging-channels-capabilities-comparison.html).

In Custom Bots integration Rich Content Event (`RichContentEvent`) is passed via the property `event` which is part of another property `lpEvent`
that is sent with `context` information. An example of the request body containing `RichContentEvent` can be seen below:

```javascript
const {
  message,
  convId,
  context: {
    lpEvent: {
      event: { type, content }, // this contain the RichContentEvent
    },
  },
} = input.payload;
```

A sample `RichContentEvent` request of a user who shared location via WhatsApp will look like this:

```json
{
  "convId": "abcdefg-1234-a1b2-6787-fkljwuhs7yk2",
  "context": {
    "lpEvent": {
      "event": {
        "type": "RichContentEvent",
        "content": {
          "type": "vertical",
          "elements": [
            {
              "type": "map",
              "la": 49.82380908513249,
              "lo": 2.021484375,
              "alt": "49.82380908513249, 2.021484375"
            }
          ]
        }
      },
    "lpSdes": {}
  },
  "message": "com.liveperson.bot-connectors.consumer.send-rich-content" // Message from Third-Party Bots will be sent as this value
}
```

A minimal Custom Integration function code for the demonstration of WhatsApp sharing location can be seen below. This Custom Integration function will
check if the input payload has `RichContentEvent` then will respond with the entire body.

```javascript
function lambda(input, callback) {
  const payload = {
    messages: [],
    context: {},
  };
  const {
    message,
    context: { lpEvent: { event: { type = "", content = {} } = {} } = {} } = {},
  } = input.payload;

  if (message && message.toLowerCase() === "hi") {
    payload.messages.push("Hi there! How can I help you today?");
  } else if (
    message &&
    message === "com.liveperson.bot-connectors.consumer.send-rich-content" &&
    type === "RichContentEvent"
  ) {
    payload.messages.push(
      `I received a rich content it contains: ${JSON.stringify(input.content)} `
    );
  } else {
    payload.messages.push("I am sorry i don't understand. Can you repeat?");
  }

  callback(null, payload);
}
```

We can see the above Custom Integration function in action below:
