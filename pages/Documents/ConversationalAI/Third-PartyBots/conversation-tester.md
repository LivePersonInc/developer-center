### Introduction
By using the Conversation Tester, you will be able to evaluate the conversational flow of your bot identify issues with any responses sent by the bot.
The Conversation Tester feature aims to help you to identify possible misconfiguration in your bot. This provides three important components. First, the chat window in which you can start testing your bot. Second, the Logs column in which you will see if your bot response was processed or had an error. And finally, the JSON EDITOR column will help you to identify the error cause.

#### Successful Response
When you are testing your bot, and you are getting a `Processed` response, it means that the bot configuration is valid and the bot responded with a valid message. See the image below.

#### Error Response
When you are testing your bot, and no valid response is received from the bot you will be shown an error and any data received will be shown in the JSON Editor.
By hovering on the last alert you will see a tooltip that will give you the possible solutions for your error. See the image below.

### Limitations

{: .important}
The Conversation Tester will only show the direct responses of the connected bot. No configured [Hooks](third-party-bots-hook-configuration.html) or [Public API](third-party-bots-public-api.html) calls will be computed by the Conversation Tester.

{: .important}
The Medallia Survey vendor is not supported by the Conversation Tester since survey messages on this vendor are exclusively received via the [Public API](third-party-bots-public-api.html).
