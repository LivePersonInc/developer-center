#### Conversation tester.
## Introduction
By using the Conversation tester, you will be able to test your bot and identify if your bot's response has the right configuration.
The Conversation Tester feature aims to help you to identify possible misconfiguration in your bot. This provides three important components. First, the chat window in which you can start testing your bot. Second, the Logs column in which you will see if your bot response was processed or had an error. And finally, the JSON EDITOR column will help you to identify the error cause.
 
## Processed Response
When you are testing your bot and you get a successful response, it means that your bot's response has the correct configuration. See the image below.

## Error Response
When testing your bot and you get an error in the response, you will be able to see what was the JSON object that produced the error in your bot response. By hovering on the last alert you will see a tooltip that will give you the possible solutions for your error. See the image below.
