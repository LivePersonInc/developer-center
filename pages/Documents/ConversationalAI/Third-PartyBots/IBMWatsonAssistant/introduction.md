### Overview

The following documentation outlines the configuration for the connector and how to implement functions specifically for **IBM Watson Assistant Version 1 & 2**.

{: .notice}
**IMPORTANT**: In case of inactivity, the Watson Assistant session only last 5 minutes for the Lite/Standard plans and up to 60 minutes for Plus/Premium plans. Because of the asynchronous nature of messaging, it could take longer until the user replies to the bot agent. In case the Watson session expires, the bot connector will create a new conversation session on the Watson side [More Info](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtime#dialog-runtime-context).

### Watson Version 1 Configuration

{: .important}
See the [Getting Started](third-party-bots-getting-started.html) guide before using this document to complete pre-requisite steps.

{: .important}
**Please note** that Watson does not support processing newline, tab and carriage-return characters. These symbols will be removed from any query that is sent to Watson via the provided connector.

With watson there are two ways of authentication that currently our system support, these are UserPass and IAM (token based) authentication. You can choose one of them for your bot configuration.

#### UserPass authentication

You will be presented with following screen to complete the Vendor Settings in order to add bot connector using UserPass authentication.

You have to agree to Data Disclaimer from now onward in order to use the services of bot connector. For that you can click on the checkbox "I agree to the Data Disclaimer

#### Test Connection

For validation of the credentials provided, you can now perform a test connection request to see if everything that you have provided is working and reachable. You can click on the button "Test Connection" to see if connection succeed or fail. For UserPass authentication see in Figure 1.3 and 1.4. For IAM authentication see in Figure 1.5 and 1.6.

<div class="notice">
Please be careful while providing credentials that you have selected the right workspace URL. Selecting the wrong Watson Assistant gateway causes connection failure.
</div>

Once you are done with providing configuration you can save it by pressing on "Done". **_Congratulations!_** You have completed the configuration of the Watson Assistant bot.

### Watson Assistant Version 2 Configuration

{: .important}
See the [Getting Started](third-party-bots-getting-started.html) guide before using this document to complete pre-requisite steps.

{: .important}
**Please note** that Watson does not support processing newline, tab and carriage-return characters. These symbols will be removed from any query that is sent to Watson via the provided connector.

With Watson V2 there are two methods of authentication that are currently supported. These methods are username/password and IAM (token based) authentication. You can choose either one for your bot configuration but IAM is **highly recommended** (as it is more secure).

#### UserPass authentication

You will be presented with following screen to complete the Vendor Settings in order to add the bot connector using username/password authentication.
