**Please note** that the new IBM Watson Assistant experience is not fully supported yet. So please switch to the classic experience using this [guide](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-welcome-new-assistant)

{: .attn-note}
Following guide is going to present customization for the Watson Assistant on how to implement functions specifically for **IBM Watson**. It is intended for users who are familiar with IBM Watson cloud dashboard. Continue if you are familiar and have access to IBM Watson cloud dashboard.

### Sending Encoded Metadata

Conversational Cloud Messaging platform provides a new metadata input type (“encodedMetadata”) for passing a base64 encoded metadata on a conversation. The new metadata input type is in addition to the existing [conversation metadata](messaging-agent-sdk-conversation-metadata-guide.html) input field. Third-party Bot also supports this property and this section will cover the information needed for you to send encoded metadata within your conversations. Before sending encoded metadata you must ensure the following conditions in order to successfully send the data.

<ul>
  <li><b>Common.EncodedMetadata</b> AC feature is ON</li>
  <li>Content is base64 encoded</li>
  <li> Metadata size is limited to 5k</li>
</ul>

{: .attn-note}
Failing to comply with the above validation points will cause the message to be dropped. This feature is only available for the messaging conversations not for chat conversations

Encoded Metadata can be sent with simple Text, Rich Content (structured content) and Multiple responses. The `encodedMetadata` can be defined with context editor or using the JSON editor (Figure 3.1). In both ways, Third-Party Bot leverages the context variables to send the encoded metadata. The encoded metadata is passed throughout the conversation responses unless it is overwritten by upcoming `encodedMetadata`. Then the upcoming `encodedMetadata` will be passed along the responses.

  Figure 3.1 Showing options of JSON editor and context editor

{: .attn-note}
Be careful with the camel-case characters `encodedMetadata` you must provide it exactly the same.

#### Sending Watson Native Content with Encoded Metadata

Sending encoded metadata with the Native Content (Text, Image and Options) is possible using Watson `context editor` or also through the `JSON editor`. An example response definition for both ways can be seen below:

  <img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/watsonassistant/watson_encoded_metadata_context_editor.png" alt="">
  Figure 3.2 Showing context editor with the encoded metadata.

<br />

Example response body for `JSON editor`:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "generic": [
      {
        "values": [
          {
            "text": "This is text with encoded metadata"
          }
        ],
        "response_type": "text",
        "selection_policy": "sequential"
      }
    ]
  },
  "context": {
    "encodedMetadata": "ewoiaWQiOiAidGV4dCIKfQ=="
  }
}
```

#### Sending Rich Content (Structured Content) with Encoded Metadata

Sending encoded metadata with the Native Content is possible using Watson `context editor` or also through the `JSON editor`. An example response definition for both ways can be seen below:

  <img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/watsonassistant/watson_encoded_metadata_with_structured_content.png" alt="">
  Figure 3.3 Showing context editor with the encoded metadata.

<br />

```json
{
  "output": {
    "text": {
      "values": [
        {
          "metadata": [
            {
              "id": "1234",
              "type": "ExternalId"
            }
          ],
          "structuredContent": {
            "type": "vertical",
            "elements": [
              {
                "type": "button",
                "click": {
                  "actions": [
                    {
                      "text": "Recommend me a movie, please",
                      "type": "publishText"
                    }
                  ]
                },
                "title": "Recommend a movie"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ],
      "selection_policy": "sequential"
    }
  },
  "context": {
    "encodedMetadata": "ewoiaWQiOiAic2MiCn0="
  }
}
```

If you have a different context for multiple dialogs in a conversation that are responding with structure content, then you can define the `encodedMetadata` for each of the dialog separately. In that case, you will not define `encodedMetadata` via context editor or inside `context` property if using JSON editor. Below example shows where `encodedMetadata` property should be placed in structured content. Please note you will have to use JSON editor for defining such case:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "text": {
      "values": [
        {
          "encodedMetadata": "ewoiaWQiOiAic2MiCn0=",
          "metadata": [
            {
              "id": "1234",
              "type": "ExternalId"
            }
          ],
          "structuredContent": {
            "type": "vertical",
            "elements": [
              {
                "type": "button",
                "click": {
                  "actions": [
                    {
                      "text": "Recommend me a movie, please",
                      "type": "publishText"
                    }
                  ]
                },
                "title": "Recommend a movie"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ],
      "selection_policy": "sequential"
    }
  },
  "context": {}
}
```

### Sending Private Text Message

It is possible to send a private text message from the Live Engage (LE-UI) via agent workspace. This feature can now be used via the Third-Party bots as well. This will allow Brands to define private message text within the conversational flow of the bot. These messages are published into the conversation for other Agent/Manger participants. This enables Brands to customize messages giving more insight, summarizing actions taken by the bot, or also advising on next actions the handover agent should take.

{: .attn-note}
Please note If you have not migrated to new Agent Workspace you will not be able to see the `Private` message indicator in the conversation window. Nevertheless, private text messages will not be shown to the consumer and only remain visible to Agents and Managers.

Please note private text message will never be shown to the consumer and will be visible only inside the conversation window of agent workspace. The private text message can be added via Watson's `JSON editor` (as shown in Figure 9.1). There are two properties, `text` and `messageAudience` required for sending a private text message.

| key             | value                                 | notes                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| text            | any string value                      | mandatory                 |
| messageAudience | value should be "AGENTS_AND_MANAGERS" | case sensitive, mandatory |

<br />

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/watsonassistant/context_adding_choices.png" alt="">
Figure 3.4 Showing JSON editor option access via Watson Assistant.

It is possible to send only a private text message response. The example payload of such response is below (also Figure 3.5 `JSON Editor` view):

```json
{
  "output": {
    "text": {
      "values": [
        {
          "text": "This is a private text",
          "messageAudience": "AGENTS_AND_MANAGERS"
        }
      ],
      "selection_policy": "sequential"
    }
  }
}
```

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/watsonassistant/private_message_response_custom_payload.png" alt="">
Figure 3.5 Showing single private text message definition inside `JSON Editor`

It is also possible to send a private text message with the action (e.g. Transfer / Escalations). Example payload of such a case (Private Text Message — Action) will be as below:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "text": {
      "values": [
        {
          "text": "This is a private text",
          "messageAudience": "AGENTS_AND_MANAGERS"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "TRANSFER",
      "type": "client",
      "parameters": {
        "skill": "human_skill"
      },
      "result_variable": "none"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Invoke LivePerson Function

During a conversation, it is possible to trigger a LivePerson Function that is deployed to the
[LivePerson Functions](liveperson-functions-overview.html) (Function as a Service) platform.
This provides a way to run custom logic with a bot.

To invoke a LivePerson Function, we utilize the action object as we did for a [bot action](third-party-bots-ibm-watson-assistant-basic-content.html#bot-actions).
In **Figure 3.6** below, the **Watson Assistant** JSON response should be mirrored as follows:

```json-doc
{
  "output": {
    "text": {
      "values": [
        "Trigger LivePerson Function"
      ]
    }
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "INVOCATION",
      "type": "client",
      "parameters": {
        "lambdaUuid": "4ec49ffc-080b-4e59-b302-18d6b826191b",
        "payload": "{ "some": "stuff"}",
        "failOnError": true

      },
      "result_variable": "none"
    }
  ]
}
```

Figure 3.6 Watson Assistant JSON response for invoking LivePerson Function

To retrieve the **_lambdaUuid_** of your LivePerson Function follow [this guide](https://developers.liveperson.com/liveperson-functions-foundations-external-invocation.html#function-uuid)

In addition, it is possible to send your own payload to the function. Set your content inside the **payload** parameter

The bot does not escalate on a failed invocation by default. To enable this, set the additional parameter **failOnError** to **true**

### Engagement attributes as context

Third-Party bots allows the collection of engagement attributes (more information can be found [here](engagement-attributes-types-of-engagement-attributes.html)) if `Engagement Attributes` option is checked in the `Conversation Type` step as shown in Figure 3.7.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:750px" src="img/ThirdPartyBots/common-engagement-attr-select.png" alt="">
Figure 3.7 Conversation Type step in creation/modification of bot configuration.

These attributes are **only** collected at the start of a conversation. Third-Party bots leverage the LivePerson Visit Information API to collect the engagement attributes, Further information Visit Information API can be found [here](visit-information-api-visit-information.html). Moreover, Engagement attributes are not updated throughout the life cycle of a conversation and only passed along with each message request. In Watson Assistant V1 these engagement attributes are added to the property `lpSdes`. For the preservation of these attributes within a conversation, `context` property is used (further information about `context` can be found [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant-v1#get-response-to-user-input)). An example of the request body can be seen below:

```json-doc
{
  "message": "Some Message",
  "context": {
    // … contains some more information about conversation as well
    "lpEvent": {}, // Holds LP Events
    "lpSdes": {} // Holds SDES
  }
}
```

### Receiving Rich Content Response (Messaging Only)

Third-Party Bots allows LivePerson's Rich Messaging channel capabilities not only to be received
as a response from the vendor but also, allow Rich Messages (Structured Content) to be sent back
to the vendor based on specific user interactions/responses (For example user sharing their
location on WhatsApp).
Please note these capabilities are sometimes limited by the channels in which the conversation
is happening. For the list of Rich Messaging capabilities for each channel,
browse or search the table on the [Knowledge Center](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/messaging-channels-messaging-channels-capabilities-comparison.html).

An example use case of the Rich Content Event (`RichContentEvent`) response sent by Third-Party
Bots is described below. The example will show how to set up and access the `RichContentEvent`
response with Watson Assistant after a user shares the location.

Usually a `RichContentEvent` of type map/location will have following JSON schema:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "type": "vertical",
    "elements": [
      {
        "la": 49.82380908513249,
        "type": "map",
        "alt": "49.82380908513249, 2.021484375",
        "lo": 2.021484375
      }
    ]
  },
  "type": "RichContentEvent"
}
```

#### Create Intent for RichContentEvent

We needs to create a intent that should have training phase `com.liveperson.bot-connectors.consumer.send-rich-content` as shown in the Figure 3.8 below

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:600px" src="img/watsonassistant/watson_richcontentevent-intent.png" alt="">
Figure 3.8 Intent creation in Watson Assistant console

#### Access RichContentEvent in Dialog

There are two ways in which a RichContentEvent can be accessed in IBM Watson Assistant.
You can either access the raw data directly in the node configuration or you can
leverage the IBM Cloud Functions to handle more complex scenarios for your business cases.
We will define our demo example for both use cases below.

##### Accessing the RichContentEvent via node configuration

The `RichContentEvent` is sent with the context. Thus, for Watson Assistant, we can leverage
the [Context Variables](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtime-context#dialog-runtime-context-variables)
for accessing the `RichContentEvent` data. The context information that is sent by Third-Party Bots contains in `$lpEvent`.
An example of accessing `RichContentEvent` from that context variable can be seen in Figure 3.9.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:600px" src="img/watsonassistant/watson_richcontentevent-access-event.png" alt="">
Figure 3.9 Displaying how to access the Rich Content/Structured Content using Context Variables

##### Accessing the RichContentEvent Data via IBM Cloud Functions

The `RichContentEvent` is sent with the context. Thus, for Watson Assistant, we can leverage
the [IBM Cloud Functions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-getting-started)
for responding to the `RichContentEvent`. The `RichContentEvent` information is accessed via
[Context Variables](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtime-context#dialog-runtime-context-variables).
The context variable that is sent by the Third-Party bot is `$lpEvent`.

We can use an [action](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-actions_over)
cloud function to access the `RichContentEvent` data and attach this action as a webhook to
the IBM Watson Assistant instance.

A code snippet of an IBM Cloud Function of type `action` can be seen below. This LivePerson function
will check if the input payload has `RichContentEvent` in the request and then will respond with
the map/location body.

```javascript
/**
 *
 * main() will be run when you invoke this action
 *
 * @param contains the lpEvent variables that is passed from the Dialog Node
 *
 * @return The output message for for Rich Content Event
 *
 */
function main(params) {
  const { lpEvent: { event = {} } = {} } = ({} = params);

  let message = "rich content not found";

  if (event && event.type && event.type === "RichContentEvent") {
    // Default response for Rich Content
    message = `Found Rich Content Event Raw data: ${JSON.stringify(event)} `;

    // If we find Rich Content Event of type Map then respond different for E2E Tests
    if (
      event.content &&
      event.content.elements &&
      event.content.elements &&
      Array.isArray(event.content.elements)
    ) {
      message = `you sent me this location: ${event.content.elements[0]}`;
    }
  }

  return { message };
}
```

Once the function is created and you have the link to the endpoint to call the IBM Cloud Function,
this can then be attached to an IBM Watson Assistant instance via the Webhooks option. An example of
this can be seen in Figure 3.10 below

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:600px" src="img/watsonassistant/ibm-watson-assistant-webhook-config.png" alt="">
Figure 3.10 IBM Watson Assistant Webhooks configuration to an IBM Cloud Function

**Please Note** the ending of the endpoint with `.json` this is needed to be added additionally to
the endpoint of the IBM Cloud Function if you expect the response from the IBM Cloud Function
as JSON Object. Like in our above example code of function it was in the property `message`.

After setting up the Webhook configuration we need to now configure the Dialog node which is replying
to the intent of `RichContentEvent` an example of the configuration of the dialog node can be seen in
Figure 3.11 below:

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:600px" src="img/watsonassistant/dialog-node-webhook-richcontent-setup.png" alt="">
Figure 3.11 A Dialog Node setup for a RichContentEvent

We can see in Figure 3.11 that `$lpEvent` context variable is passed as parameter `lpEvent`
which was accessed in the IBM Cloud Function implementation we wrote above. The result is
returned to the variable `webhook_result_1` and then the response is accessed via
`$webhook_result_1.message`.

A demo of our WhatsApp map example with both of the above bot configurations (defined above) can be seen below:

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:300px" src="img/watsonassistant/watson_v1_richcontent_demo.gif" alt="">

### Receiving Last consumer message (Messaging Only)

Third-Party bot now provides a way to add the last consumer message as a part of the welcome event. When an ongoing conversation gets transferred to a new Agent or Skill, This enhancement will allow brands to respond to the last consumer message uttered as per their needs.

The last consumer message is passed via the property `lastConsumerMessage` which is part of another property `lpEvent` that is sent with `context` information by Third-Party Bots. Thus, for Watson Assistant, we can leverage the [Context Variables](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtime-context#dialog-runtime-context-variables)

An example of accessing `lastConsumerMessage` from that context variable can be seen in Figure 3.12.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:600px" src="img/ThirdPartyBots/watson_consumer-message-access-event.png">
Figure 3.12 Displaying how to access the last consumer message using Context Variables

### Watson Discovery

Discovery Search is a tool that uses the knowledge of websites, documents and other data, to generate an answer the Watson Bot is able to send within a conversation. If enabled, the bot searches for matching parts of the provided information on specified intents or in case no matching intent was found.

To use Watson Discovery the Watson Assistant Bot needs to have a [search skill](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/content/course/integrate-ibm-watson-assistant-and-watson-discovery/create-a-search-skill) linked to a [Watson Discovery Instance](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/content/course/integrate-ibm-watson-assistant-and-watson-discovery/create-a-watson-discovery-instance)

### Disambiguation Responses

Disambiguation is a feature configurable in the Watson Assistant UI. It triggers if a bot can't confidently identify an intent.
Find details on how it works [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtime#dialog-runtime-disambiguation).
Disambiguation responses will be renders as `Quick Replies`.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:600px" src="img/ThirdPartyBots/watson2-disambiguation.png" alt="">
Figure 3.13 Configure Watson Disambiguation

### Prevent Transferring loop behavior

As a good practice and to prevent that the bot goes into a conversation loop during off hours, create a separate bot for off-hour times that only listens to the human skill and not to the regular bot skills. If another bot is not created for that period, the bot can get into a transferring loop.

### Limitations

- Currently IBM Watson Assistant retains sessions only for 5 minutes for Free and 60 minutes for Plus or premium members. For more information [read here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtime#dialog-runtime-context)
- Currently IBM Watson allows **only 5** response types per node.
