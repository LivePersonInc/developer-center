This section will describe The responses that are expected to be sent by the
[Send Conversation Events](third-party-bots-custom-endpoint-service-implementation.html#send-conversation-events)
endpoint of the Custom Endpoint service. To ensure the validity of the response, brands can use our
[Conversation Tester feature](third-party-bots-conversation-tester.html).
In the case of Structure Content validation, you can also leverage
[this tool](https://livepersoninc.github.io/json-pollock/editor/).

### Sending Rich Content (Structured Content)

Structured Content/Rich Content is supported by the core LivePerson platform. Documentation
for the feature can be found [here](getting-started-with-rich-messaging-introduction.html).

{: .important}
If images are sent in Rich content, their URLs must be added to a whitelist via internal
LivePerson configuration (Houston: `messaging.rich.content.valid.urls`). Please note that you
must add all possible domains to this list manually as wildcards are not supported. Moreover,
All domains must be HTTPS secure.

An example of a Rich Content message response along with any optional metadata and analytical
information (intents) can be seen in Figure 3.1 below. More information on responses expected
by Third-Party Bot Connector can be found at [API Service Specification](https://github.com/LivePersonInc/third-party-bots-custom-endpoint-reference-service)

```json
{
  "response": [
    {
      "type": "STRUCTURED_CONTENT",
      "data": {
        "metadata": [{ "type": "ExternalId", "id": "ABCD1234" }],
        "structuredContent": {

              },
              "title": "Recommend a movie"
            }

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Sending Quick Replies (Structured Content)

{: .important}
**Please note** Quick Replies are only supported in Messaging Conversations.

Quick Replies is a special type of Structured Content. It is a message sent along with predefined answers.
For detailed information on Quick Replies check out the documentation for the specific channel ([Mobile SDK and Web](mobile-sdk-and-web-templates-quick-replies-template.html), [Facebook Messenger](facebook-messenger-templates-quick-replies-template.html),
[Google RCS Business Messaging](google-rcs-business-messaging-templates-quick-replies-template.html)).

An example of a Quick Replies message response along with any optional metadata and analytical
information (intents) can be seen below in Figure 3.2. More information on responses expected
by Third-Party Bot Connector can be found at [API Service Specification](https://github.com/LivePersonInc/third-party-bots-custom-endpoint-reference-service)

    ]
  }

### Bot Actions

{: .notice}
Please note we only support **ONE ACTION** per response

#### Transfer

If the bot needs to transfer the conversation to a human agent, or the conversation flow
indicates that another bot is better suited for the identified intent, you will need to
tell the connector to transfer the conversation to a given skill.

Multiple scenarios for transfer/escalations exist and are as follows:

1. If the Bot does not have an appropriate answer, it should recognize this as a scenario
   for a transfer. Depending on the connector configuration or the decision-making capacity
   of the bot, the bot will transfer to a particular skill or default skill.

2. Explicit request from a visitor to transfer to an agent

3. If there is an internal error in the Third-Party connector or the Custom Endpoint service
   cannot be reached then the Third-Party Bot connector will transfer to a default skill setup
   during configuration.

Transfer action has two sets of responses that are as below:

##### Transfer to Skill

In this case, transfer action will happen to the given skill name (case sensitive) that is passed.
An example of such a response can be seen below in Figure 3.3. More information on responses expected
by Third-Party Bot Connector can be found at [API Service Specification](https://github.com/LivePersonInc/third-party-bots-custom-endpoint-reference-service)

```json
{
  "response": [
    {
      "type": "TEXT",
      "data": {
        "message": "I am sorry i couldn't help you. I will transfer you"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "ACTION",
      "data": {
        "name": "TRANSFER",
        "parameters": { "skillName": "transfer_skill" }
      }
    }
  ],
  "analytics": {
    "intents": [
      {
        "id": "base-transfer",
        "description": "Custom Transfer",
        "confidenceScore": 1
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

##### Transfer to Agent

{: .important}
This feature is depending on [permissions](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/contact-center-management-messaging-operations-transfer-to-agent.html#permissions)

This option transfers the conversation to the particular agent matching the provided agentId
and skill. If the agent is not available, the conversation will be transferred to an available
agent with the same skill.

An example response can be seen below in Figure 3.4. More information on responses expected
by Third-Party Bot Connector can be found at [API Service Specification](https://github.com/LivePersonInc/third-party-bots-custom-endpoint-reference-service)

```json
{
  "response": [
    {
      "type": "TEXT",
      "data": {
        "message": "I am sorry i couldn't help you. I will try to transfer you to our Agent X"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "ACTION",
      "data": {
        "name": "TRANSFER",
        "parameters": {
          "skillName": "transfer_agent_skill",
          "agentId": "1234567"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "analytics": {
    "intents": [
      {
        "id": "agent-transfer",
        "description": "Custom Agent Transfer",
        "confidenceScore": 1
      },
      {
        "id": "base-transfer",
        "description": "Transfer",
        "confidenceScore": 0.9
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Close Conversation

In the botâ€™s flow, there will be times when it is appropriate to end the conversation
without escalating to a live agent. If a query has been answered, or the brand has
determined that no escalation is required for a given query, then it is best practice
to have the bot end the conversation. An example response can be seen below in Figure 3.5.
More information on responses expected by Third-Party Bot Connector can be found at
[API Service Specification](https://github.com/LivePersonInc/third-party-bots-custom-endpoint-reference-service)

```json
{
  "response": [
    { "type": "TEXT", "data": { "message": "Alright! See you later. " } },
    {
      "type": "ACTION",
      "data": { "name": "CLOSE_CONVERSATION", "parameters": {} }
    }
  ],
  "analytics": {
    "intents": [
      {
        "id": "base-bye",
        "description": "Generic Bye Intent",
        "confidenceScore": 0.95
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Figure 3.5 Example response of a close action with a message

We also allow closing of a conversation without triggering a post conversation survey,
This can be done by adding the parameter `withoutPcs` as `true` to the parameters
property of action payload. Example response of such close action can be seen in the Figure 3.6

```json
{
  "response": [
    { "type": "TEXT", "data": { "message": "Alright! See you later. " } },
    {
      "type": "ACTION",
      "data": {
        "name": "CLOSE_CONVERSATION",
        "parameters": { "withoutPcs": true }
      }
    }
  ],
  "analytics": {
    "intents": [
      {
        "id": "base-bye",
        "description": "Generic Bye Intent",
        "confidenceScore": 0.95
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Change Time To Response of Conversation (TTR)

Change the TTR of a conversation based on the **action** value in the response object.

LivePerson Messaging uses 3 different types of priorities:

- URGENT
- NORMAL
- PRIORITIZED

Example response with `URGENT` priority can be seen below in Figure 3.7.
More information on responses expected by Third-Party Bot Connector can be found at
[API Service Specification](https://github.com/LivePersonInc/third-party-bots-custom-endpoint-reference-service)

```json
{
  "response": [
    {
      "type": "ACTION",
      "data": { "name": "CHANGE_TTR", "parameters": { "ttrType": "URGENT" } }
    }
  ],
  "analytics": {
    "intents": [
      {
        "id": "change-ttr",
        "description": "Wants to change the ttr",
        "confidenceScore": 0.9
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
