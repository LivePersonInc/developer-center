Did you know that LivePerson has a Conversational AI forum for builders? Check it out [here](https://talkyard.livepersonai.com/)!

Use the Bots Status application to check the status of all your bots from a single location, and to help to resolve issues. 

You can use the application to monitor and manage both custom bots and post-conversation survey (PCS) bots.

### Access Bots Status

{: .important}
To access the Bots Status application, you must have the Bot Status Access [permission](bot-accounts-permissions.html).

**To access the Bot Status application**

1. On the left sidebar in Conversational Cloud, click the <img class="inlineimage" style="width:30px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_cb.png"> icon.
2. In the [Conversational AI dashboard](platform-overview.html), click **Bots Status**.

### Dashboard

The dashboard provides at-a-glance reporting on the status of your agents. Click any metric to access the **Bot Agents** page with the appropriate filter pre-applied.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/botsStatus_dashboard.png">

* **Active agents**: The number of agents where the Bot Agent Connector status is "Online"
* **Agents not connected to Conversational Cloud**: The number of agents where the Conversational Cloud Connection status is "Not Connected"
* **Agents not connected to Bot Server**: The number of agents where the Bot Server Connection status is "Not Connected"
* **Stopped agents**: The number of agents where the Bot Agent Connector status is "Stopped"

Note that "N/A" for "Not Applicable" is shown in cases where an actual value doesn't apply or make sense.

### Statuses

When monitoring bots, there are three types of statuses:

* **Bot Agent Connector**: This indicates the status of the deployed connector thatâ€™s connected to the bot and handles conversations using the bot.
* **Conversation Cloud Connector**: This indicates the status of the connection between the bot agent connector and the Conversation Cloud messaging/chat server. This server sends the messages to the consumer via a channel.
* **Bot Server Connection**: This indicates the status of the connection between the bot agent connector and the bot server. This server handles bot conversations.

To view a connector's statuses, scroll to the right in the dashboard.
