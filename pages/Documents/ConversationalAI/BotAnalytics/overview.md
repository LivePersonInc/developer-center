Did you know that LivePerson has a Conversational AI forum for builders? [Check it out!](https://talkyard.livepersonai.com/)

The Bot Analytics application is intended to provide real time data on your bots, so you can use the data to understand bot activity and thereby determine effectiveness. Given this goal, you can use the application to query for and download data for any 60-day time period in the last 13 months. If you need to download at one time the data for a longer time period, use [Analytics Builder](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/data-reporting-report-builder-report-builder-overview.html).

### Access Bot Analytics

1. [Access the dashboard of Conversational AI applications](get-started-with-automation.html#access-the-conversational-ai-applications).
2. Click **Bot Analytics**.
