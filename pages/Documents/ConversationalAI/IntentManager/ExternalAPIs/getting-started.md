Here are a few things you'll need to get started with these APIs:

1. **Retrieve your domain.** Use the [LivePerson Domain API](domain-api.html) to retrieve this information by providing the following service name:

    * Read only: accountConfigReadOnly
    * Read/Write: accountConfigReadWrite

2. Note the [API terms of use](https://www.liveperson.com/policies/apitou/).
