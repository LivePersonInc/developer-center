### Using intents

An [intent](intent-manager-key-terms-concepts.html#intents) is a consumer request for action or info from your brand.

#### Use intents to trigger bot flows

In a Conversation Builder bot, you can trigger a dialog flow if the consumer's query matches the intent that's associated with the dialog starter. To set this up, you use Conversation Builder's [Assist tool](conversation-builder-assist.html) to associate the dialog starter with the domain and the intent.

Looking for a tutorial? See the [Intents tutorial](tutorials-guides-getting-started-with-bot-building-intents.html).

#### Use intents to return answers from knowledge bases

If you have a Conversation Builder bot that integrates with KnowledgeAI to return answers from knowledge bases in responses to consumer queries, you can [use Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and intents to find the right answers](knowledgeai-using-intents-with-kbs.html) to return.

### Using entities

An [entity](intent-manager-key-terms-concepts.html#entities) is any word(s) or series of characters that consistently refers to (an attribute of) a single person, place, or thing, or set of same, e.g., SPORT, SIZE, HELP_DESK_TICKET_NUMBER, or CITY.

{: .note}
Remember when using entities that entity names are case-sensitive.

#### Capture entities using Conversation Builder's Assist

Use Conversation Builder's **Assist** tool to [associate a question with a custom entity](conversation-builder-assist.html#associate-a-question-with-an-entity), so you can capture the consumer's response as the value of that entity.

When you use Assist to associate a question with a custom entity, Assist automatically creates a [slot](conversation-builder-variables-slots-slots.html) to store the consumer's response. A slot is a special &mdash; and powerful &mdash; type of variable that brings dynamic, fluid behavior to storing consumer input.

Using Assist is the easiest way to capture an entity, and it should suit most use cases. For more advanced use cases, such as those that involve modifying or cleaning entities, you can use the [getNamedEntities](conversation-builder-scripting-functions-get-set-session-data.html#get-named-entities) scripting function.

#### Detect entities using JavaScript

Use the [getNamedEntities](conversation-builder-scripting-functions-get-set-session-data.html#get-named-entities) scripting function.
