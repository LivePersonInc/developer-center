1. [Get started](intent-manager-getting-started.html) with a prebuilt domain, import your existing intents, or add the initial intents and training phrases manually.
2. Understand the existing model: Review the model’s coverage, i.e., the intent names and training phrases. This gives you a good understanding of the intents that already exist in the model. This is important to keep in mind, as you don’t want your future work to overlap with any of the existing intents.
3. Use [intent discovery](intent-manager-discover-intent-discovery.html) (the **Discover** page) to find new intents to add to your current taxonomy and to classify consumer messages under those intents.
4. [Train the new model](intent-manager-build-domains.html#train-a-domain).
5. Evaluate and improve the model. As a quick measure, review the results on the Intent Manager [dashboard](intent-manager-dashboard.html). For more thorough testing, use the [Model Tester](intent-manager-build-test-with-the-model-tester.html) (on the **Build** page).
