### What's an entity?

An [entity](intent-manager-key-terms-concepts.html#entities) is any word(s) or series of characters that consistently refers to (an attribute of) a single person, place, or thing, or set of same, e.g., SPORT, SIZE, HELP_DESK_TICKET_NUMBER, or CITY.

There are three types of entities:

* [Value Set](intent-manager-key-terms-concepts.html#value-set-entities) - You define these.
* [Regular Expression](intent-manager-key-terms-concepts.html#regular-expression-entities) - You define these.
* [Global](intent-manager-key-terms-concepts.html#global-entities) - These are automatically detected by the system; see [the complete list](intent-manager-key-terms-concepts.html#global-entities).

Use entities to fill [slots](conversation-builder-variables-slots-slots.html) in Conversation Builder bots.

### Add a Value Set entity

1. [Access Intent Manager](intent-manager-overview.html#access-intent-manager).
2. Locate the domain list in the Intent Manager dashboard.
3. Select the name of the relevant domain, and then select **Build** from the menu that appears.
4. Select the **Entities** page.
5. In the upper-right corner, click **Add Entity**.
6. Specify the following:
    * **Entity Name**: Enter the name of the entity using alphanumeric characters (no special characters). Consider using all capital letters and underscores (instead of spaces) as a convention; this makes the entities readily visible when they are used in intents and knowledge bases. Note that entity names are case-sensitive.
    * **Description**: Enter a short phrase describing the entity. While this field is optional, it's often useful. Many entity names can be technical. A description adds clarity and is particularly helpful to a person not familiar with the domain.
    * **Entity Type**: Select "Value Set."
    * **Entity Values**: Enter each entity value.
7. Click **Save**.
8. Train the domain so that the addition is reflected in a new model version.

### Add a Regular Expression entity

{: .attn-note}
Regular Expression entities are available only in domains using the [LivePerson engine](intent-manager-natural-language-understanding-liveperson-nlu-engine.html#liveperson-nlu-engine) for NLU.

**To add a Regular Expression entity**

1. [Access Intent Manager](intent-manager-overview.html#access-intent-manager).
2. Locate the domain list in the Intent Manager dashboard.
3. Select the name of the relevant domain, and then select **Build** from the menu that appears.
4. Select the **Entities** page.
5. In the upper-right corner, click **Add Entity**.
6. Specify the following:
    * **Entity Name**: Enter the name of the entity using alphanumeric characters (no special characters). Consider using all capital letters and underscores (instead of spaces) as a convention; this makes the entities readily visible when they are used in intents and knowledge bases. Note that entity names are case-sensitive.
    * **Description**: Enter a short phrase describing the entity. While this field is optional, it's often useful. Many entity names can be technical. A description adds clarity and is particularly helpful to a person not familiar with the domain.
    * **Entity Type**: Select "Regular Expression."
    * **Regular Expression**: Enter the regular expression. All standard [RegEx rules](https://regex101.com/) apply.
    * **Sample Values**: Enter five (5) example values that conform to the regular expression. These values aren't used during entity detection; they're used during domain training to improve the model's performance with respect to intent matching. Within Intent Manager, the sample values also serve as easy-to-read examples of the regular expression, making the expression more understandable at a glance.

        Start with five (5) sample values. If your results aren't as expected, you can add more and then retrain.
7. Click **Save**.
8. Train the domain so that the addition is reflected in a new model version.

### Add or update entity values in bulk

Use the **Bulk Add** or **Bulk Edit** features, respectively, to add or edit a set of entity values in bulk.

When you click the link, all of the values are placed into a single field. This means you can make changes to all or some of them in bulk. For example, you can:

* Insert a number of additional values at the top or bottom. This is handy if you have the values in a separate file. You can quickly copy them and paste them in.
* Select a number of values and delete them all at once. This is faster than doing so one by one.

{: .attn-note}
To save your changes, click the **Update Entity** button. Once you save the changes, they canâ€™t be reverted. To cancel, navigate away from the page without saving the changes.

Take care when using this feature to avoid making unintended changes:

* To replace what exists, paste over it.
* To add to what exists, paste the additions into (not over) the list.
* Ensure that each value is on a different line.

### Delete an entity

Deleting an entity is a non-recoverable action, so be certain about doing so before taking this action.

{: .attn-note}
Before you delete an entity, ensure that it isn't being used in any intents or Knowledge Base articles.

**To delete an entity**

1. [Access Intent Manager](intent-manager-overview.html#access-intent-manager).
2. Locate the domain list in the Intent Manager dashboard.
3. Select the name of the relevant domain, and then select **Build** from the menu that appears.
4. Select the **Entities** page.
5. In the left panel, select the entity.
6. Click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_ellipsis_vertical.png" alt="Three-dot icon"> (3-dot icon), and select **Delete**.
7. In the confirmation dialog, click **Yes**.
8. Train the domain so that the deletion is reflected in a new model version.
