There are a few ways to get started:
* Use a prebuilt domain
* Import existing intents

### Use a prebuilt domain

To get you quickly up and running with intents, LivePerson provides a set of [prebuilt domains](intent-manager-key-terms-concepts.html#prebuilt-domains) that can easily be added to the Intent Manager environment.

### Import existing intents

If you have an existing intent classification model that you have created with an external NLU service, you can [import those intents and training phrases](intent-manager-build-domains.html#add-a-domain-manually-or-using-an-import-file) to use as a starting point for further optimization. Prior to import, your data must be [formatted in a tabular CSV format](intent-manager-build-domains.html#create-an-import-file).
