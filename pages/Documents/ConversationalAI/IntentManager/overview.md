Did you know that LivePerson has a Conversational AI forum for builders? [Check it out!](https://talkyard.livepersonai.com/)

### Introduction

Consumers often request an action or information from a brand. These consumer requests can be grouped under named categories that we call “intents.” Examples of common intents include:

* Check order status: “What is the status of my lawn mower order?”
* Make a payment: “Can I make a payment today for the total amount?”
* Reset password: “I forgot my password and I need to reset it.”

Intent Manager is a suite of tools for intent modeling and management. You can use it to:

* *Discover* intents that can or should be automated
* *Build* an intent taxonomy
* *Optimize* how well they are being fulfilled
* *Analyze* the most popular consumer intents
