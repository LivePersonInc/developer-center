### Introduction

Consumers often request an action or information from a brand. These consumer requests can be grouped under named categories that we call “intents.” Examples of common intents include:

* Check order status - “What is the status of my lawn mower order?”
* Make a payment - “Can I make a payment today for the total amount?”
* Reset password - “I forgot my password and I need to reset it.”

**Intent Manager** is a suite of tools for intent modeling and management. You can use it to:

* **Discover** intents that can or should be automated
* **Build** an intent taxonomy
* **Optimize** how well they are being fulfilled
* **Analyze** the most popular consumer intents
