There are two ways to use the Next Actions functionality:

* The REST API that can directly access CCS. A primary use case for this is to retrieve policy routing decisions when using external, third-party bots, such as Watson or DialogFlow. For more information on integrating your third-party bots with Conversational Cloud, see [here](third-party-bots-getting-started.html).
* A JavaScript function that wraps the REST API for easy use in Conversation Builder. If you want to save and delete properties in Conversation Builder, use the Javascript wrapper functions.

### JavaScript wrapper
For information on this, see [here](conversation-builder-scripting-functions-askmaven.html) in the Conversation Builder documentation.

### REST API
Every API call to the Conversation Context Service requires the following auth headers to be accepted:  
* content-Type: application/json  
* maven-api-key: {YOUR API KEY}

Base URL per environment:

* AMERICAS: https://z1.askmaven.liveperson.net
* EMEA: https://z2.askmaven.liveperson.net
* APAC: https://z3.askmaven.liveperson.net

The accountId and API key in these examples are fake; please replace them with the accountID and the developer key that you generated.
