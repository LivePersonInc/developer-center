### Understand your API version

There are two versions of the Conversation Orchestrator APIs: v1 and v2. 
v2 was released in July 2021. This newer version applies to both the Conversation Context Service and the Next Actions APIs and unlocks the following benefits:

* Higher scalability
* Better data security through the OAuth2.0 authorization mechanism
* Visibility into Dynamic Routing [policy execution logs](conversation-orchestrator-dynamic-routing-policy-logs-for-v2.html)
* Better APIs, i.e., update multiple context variables in a single call
* Better data security through improved encryption

Within this Conversation Orchestrator section of the Developer Center, please refer to the v1 or v2 documentation as appropriate for your case.

You can know you are on v2 if you see OAuth 2.0 authentication on the API Authorization page, as discussed [here](conversation-orchestrator-api-authorization.html).

### Upgrade to v2 APIs

LivePerson is gradually upgrading  all accounts to v2, as the  v1 APIs will be deprecated on December 31, 2022. If you want to be upgraded  to v2 sooner, please email us at **upgradecontext-lp@liveperson.com**.
