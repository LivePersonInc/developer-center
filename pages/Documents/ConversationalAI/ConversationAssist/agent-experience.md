No bot or answer recommendations are made when the consumer’s message is 3 words or fewer, or when the consumer’s message is non-intentful (e.g., a greeting or other phrase like, “Are you still there” or “Give me a minute,” and so on).<br><br>All recommendations that are made based on consumer utterances are cached for 3 hours. Keep this in mind as you update your bots and knowledge bases. If things look stale during testing, try using a slightly different utterance.


**Tip:** To train your agents, you can start by enabling recommendations for a single skill.

### Use a recommended bot or article
In Conversational Cloud, bot and article recommendations are displayed inline within the conversation.

**To use a recommended bot**

* Click **Delegate** to join a bot to the conversation, so the bot takes over. You stay in the conversation, so you can monitor the bot’s progress and remove the bot if needed.

    **Tip**: As shown in the image above, a system message announces when the bot joins the conversation. You can [customize this message](conversation-assist-recommendation-sources-configuring-settings.html#bot-messages).

**To use a recommended article**

* Click **Use Answer** to copy the article’s text to the agent’s text input area. You can edit the text before sending it to the consumer.

### Remove or replace the current bot

After you have joined a bot to a conversation, you can remove or replace it if desired:

* To remove the current bot, click **Remove bot** at the top of the messaging panel. The agent can then take over.
* To replace the current bot, click **Replace bot** beside the bot you want to substitute into the conversation. The selected bot joins the conversation, taking over for the previous bot. (Only one bot can be joined to a conversation at a time.)
