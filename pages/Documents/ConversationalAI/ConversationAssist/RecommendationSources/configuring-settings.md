Set the maximum number of recommendations (bot and answer) that Conversation Assist offers at one time. The default value is 3.

### Answer confidence

The consumer’s intent will be matched to the articles in the knowledge bases, where each match is assigned a score indicating the system’s confidence in the match. Select the minimum confidence score that an article must have for it to be offered as a recommended answer that can be sent to the consumer.

The higher the score, the more relevant the recommendations. To offer more recommendations, try a lower score.

### Bot confidence

Set the **Bot confidence** if you’re using bots as recommendation sources.

The consumer’s intent will be matched to the bots, where each match is assigned a score indicating the system’s confidence in the match. Select the minimum score that a bot must have for it to be offered as a recommended bot that can handle the conversation.

The higher the score, the more relevant the recommendations. To offer more recommendations, try a lower score.

### Bot messages

Customize the **bot messages** if you’re using bots as recommendation sources. The messages are sent to the consumer when the bot is added to and removed from a conversation. They help consumers to understand when a bot is involved in a conversation.
