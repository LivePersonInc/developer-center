{: .attn-note}
This is a tutorial series that's cumulative in nature. To start from the beginning, [start here](tutorials-guides-getting-started-with-bot-building-dialogs-patterns.html).

Many use cases require integration with an API to send and receive data. Following the "make payment" use case, in this tutorial you add an integration to check a user’s account balance.

{: .attn-note}
This tutorial uses an example API that returns random balance data when given an account number and email address.

### Step 8: Create the Order Status dialog

The Cross-vertical domain that you created in the previous tutorial contains a “check order status” intent that you will use in Conversation Builder to trigger a new dialog.

1. Open your Getting Started bot in Conversation Builder.
2. Create a new regular dialog named “Order Status.”

    By default, a regular dialog includes a Dialog Starter interaction, but it isn't configured yet. You'll use the [Assist tool](conversation-builder-assist.html) to do this.

3. Click <img class="inlineimage" style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/getstartedtutorial/icon_assist.png" alt="Assist icon"> (Assist icon) beside the interaction to open the Assist tool.

    Select the “LP_Cross-vertical” domain, followed by the "check order status" intent. You can locate this intent either by scrolling through the list of intents, or by searching with a phrase such as, "I want to check the status of my order." Selecting this intent associates it with the dialog starter.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/getstartedtutorial/integr_order_status.png" alt="Associating the check order status intent with the dialog starter in the Order Status dialog">

4. Add a new Text Statement to acknowledge the user's intent. Add the text, "Let’s find your order."

5. Add a new Text Question to capture the user’s order number. Add the text, "What is your order number?"

6. Still in the Text question, add a custom rule that checks whether the order number is valid:

    Select the **Next Action** dropdown, and click **+ Custom Rule** within it. In the Add Next Action Rule window, name the rule "Order number". Then click **+ Add Condition**. For the condition, select "Regular Expression" from the list of match types, and add the following regular expression (regex) to match the order number format (a letter followed by six digits): `^\w\d{6}$`.

    {: .attn-note}
    This mock API will successfully return order data for accounts A001001, A001010 and A001002.

    Still in the rule, capture the user’s order number as a variable: Click **+ Add Variable**. Name the variable `orderNumber`, and enter `{$userMessage}` for its value.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/getstartedtutorial/order_num_rule.png" alt="Adding a rule to capture the user's order number">

    {: .attn-note}
    `{$userMessage}` is just one of many system [variables](conversation-builder-variables-slots-variables.html) you can use in your interactions.

    Click **Save**.

    By saving the result of the user’s response as the variable `orderNumber`, we will have access to that data throughout the bot. In this case, we will use that within our API call to find the user’s order.

### Step 9: Create an Order Status API integration

1. In the upper-left corner, click **Integrations**.
2. On the Add Integration page, configure the integration as follows:
    * **Integration Name**: OrderStatus
    * **Response Data Variable Name**: OrderStatus
    * **Integration Type**: API
    * **Method**: GET
    * **URL**: https://5fc54a0936bc790016344a09.mockapi.io/order-status/{$botContext.orderNumber}

        Note the use of the orderNumber bot variable being interpolated onto the end of the URL string.

    * **Custom Data Fields**: These provide a simple method of displaying the results in interactions in dialogs. The return data is stored here. (For more on processing API results with custom data fields, see [this section](conversation-builder-integrations-integration-basics.html#process-api-results-with-custom-data-fields).)

    | Key | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | id | {$.api_OrderStatus.id} |
    | name | {$.api_OrderStatus.name} |
    | orderStatus | {$.api_OrderStatus.orderStatus} |
    | image | {$.api_OrderStatus.image} |

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/getstartedtutorial/integration_settings.png" alt="The Integration Settings window">

3. Click **Save**.

### Step 10: Use the integration in a dialog

1. In the upper-left corner, click **Dialogs**, and return to the Order Status dialog.
2. Following the text question where we’ve captured the user's order number, create a new **Integration** interaction.

    From the dropdown, select your newly created OrderStatus API Integration.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:700px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/getstartedtutorial/orderstatus_integr.png" alt="The Integration interaction added to the dialog">

3. To display our returned API data, select a new **Structured** interaction.

    In the Structured Question title section, add `{OrderStatus.name}`.

    {: .attn-note}
    When the Integration interaction runs, it stores the response data in the custom data fields that you configured in the integration. `OrderStatus.name` is the Response Data Variable Name followed by the name of that custom data field, which is “name.” (For a quick reference on using variables in interactions, see [this section](conversation-builder-variables-slots-the-basics.html#referencing-variables-and-slots).)

    For the subtitle, add `{OrderStatus.orderStatus}`.

    Click “ADD IMAGE” and in the **Image URL** field, add `{OrderStatus.image}`.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:700px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/getstartedtutorial/structured_q.png" alt="The configured Structured interaction">

    {: .attn-note}
    While images show properly in Preview, deployed bots need to have the image domains whitelisted. Contact your LivePerson account representative for assistance.

    Now let's test all this out.

4. Open the Preview window, and start a new session by clicking **Reset Session**.

5. Trigger the Order Status dialog by entering "What is my order status" or something else that will match our Order Status intent.

6. Following the prompt for an order number, type `A001001` as your order number, and press Enter.

7. Verify that you are successfully receiving order information that is displayed with a user’s name, order status, and image.

    Congratulations! You now understand the basics of integrations and variables.
