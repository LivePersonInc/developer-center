### Applications

- [Conversation Builder](conversation-builder-bot-workspace.html) is the primary application that allows you to design and scale AI-powered bots. Leveraging all of the other applications, this is where the user configures and designs conversational flows, API integrations, etc.

- [Intent Manager](intent-manager-overview.html) is a suite of tools for intent modeling and management. You can use it to discover intents that can or should be automated, build an intent taxonomy, optimize how well intents are being fulfilled, and analyze the most popular consumer intents.

- [KnowledgeAI](knowledgeai-overview.html) unifies and leverages your brandâ€™s content to provide fast answers to common questions and issues, and effectively automate consumer conversations at scale. Using KnowledgeAI, you can ingest and transform your existing content into messaging-ready answers and seamlessly answer consumer questions in rich, automated conversations.

- [Bot Analytics](bot-analytics-overview.html) holds all of the operational and usage data for your bots.

- [Bots Status](bots-status-overview.html) lets you monitor and manage your deployed bots.

- [Bot Accounts](bot-accounts-permissions-per-role.html) is the administration area for managing account-level details, configuring account-level settings, and defining credentials for accessing resources.

- [Conversation Orchestrator](conversation-orchestrator-overview.html) is a suite of tools for enabling efficient and personalized customer journeys at scale, while providing you with control and transparency over how AI is used in your business.

When your agents take advantage of these just-in-time recommendations, they become more efficient and save time. What's more, their conversational outcomes are improved and more consistent. Conversation Assist can even help to reduce the time to onboard new agents.
