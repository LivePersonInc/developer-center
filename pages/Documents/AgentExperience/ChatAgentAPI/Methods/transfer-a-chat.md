This method transfers a chat from an agent to a specific skill or agent.

**Note:** before using this method, it is recommended to use the [Retrieve Available Skills method](agent-chat-agent-retrieve-skills.html). This will allow you to make sure that you're transferring the chat to a skill that's currently available. Transferring the chat to a skill that is not available, will result in an error.
