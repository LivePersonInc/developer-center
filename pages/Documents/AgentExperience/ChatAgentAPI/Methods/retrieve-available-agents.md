This resource returns all agents which are not disabled in the system for the account provided in the request. The agents returned include both online and offline agents, but not agents that were disabled (for any reason).  For each agent, this resource returns details such as ID, username, nickname, and more. The resource also returns, for each agent, the agent's skills and the agent's availability to accept chats (the number of chats this agent is configured to take and the number of chats in which this agent is already involved).

This resource can be used to know to which other agents you can transfer chats. You may also want to use this method if you want to present all agents in a table (possibly indicating for each agent if they can take chats or not). In these cases you should call this resource periodically in order to be updated with other agents’ statuses.
