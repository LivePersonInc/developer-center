In the examples above, the question with attribute logicID 5 will be displayed when the 'CATS' answer is selected via the drop-down box in question with id="12786273". This behavior is set by the "showLogicId" element. Question Logic is particularly useful when the user might get a long list of options that would not be as user-friendly in a single list; or you wish to hide conditional or required questions which might not be relevant for all users completing the survey. |
