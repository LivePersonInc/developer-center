### Introduction

You can find the [Agent Sample App here](https://github.com/LivePersonInc/agent-sample-app). This is a virtual agent simulator built over the Chat Agent API. In this demo the simulator implements the following Chat Agent API endpoints:

* Conversational Cloud login

* Conversational Cloud session refresh

* Set availability to online

* Create agent session

* Check for incoming chats

* Accept chat invitation and start chat session (if there is a chat waiting in queue)

* Chat polling (wait to get messages from visitor)

* Send line

* End the chat when the transcript is over
