{: .attn-deprecation}
The legacy LivePerson CRM widgets have been deprecated. For those still requiring services related to LivePerson's legacy CRM widgets, [NAVOMI](https://navomi.com/crm-connect/) will provide the option of continued service and support at a fee starting October 15, 2022. For more information, please contact your CSM or Account Team.

This integration will allow you to see and create your Zendesk Contact tickets right from within Conversational Cloud. It will also record all Conversational Cloud transcripts in Zendesk so all your customer interactions are in one place.

Brands that use Conversational Cloud for sales and support can offer a more personalized, informed experience with access to Zendesk, by giving agents a full overview of the account, including previous or existing cases, opportunities and even potential leads. Through the Conversational Cloud Zendesk integration, agents can utilize the workspace to conduct all conversations with customers, and get instant access to pertinent information without having to open a separate browser window to manually check the Zendesk record. Agents can also search through records using the field from pre-chat surveys and/or through the widget.

Furthermore, agents have the ability to easily create records in Zendesk as part of the conversation (leads, opportunities, accounts, cases) and store the conversation transcript and additional info in the CRM after the engagement.
