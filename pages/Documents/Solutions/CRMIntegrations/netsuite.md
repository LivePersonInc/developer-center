{: .attn-deprecation}
The legacy LivePerson CRM widgets have been deprecated. For those still requiring services related to LivePerson's legacy CRM widgets, [NAVOMI](https://navomi.com/crm-connect/) will provide the option of continued service and support at a fee starting October 15, 2022. For more information, please contact your CSM or Account Team.

Integrating your NetSuite CRM directly into the Agent workspace will allow your agents to see and create NetSuite Contact, Lead, Account and Opportunity record data right from within Conversational Cloud. It will also allow you to view your Conversational Cloud transcripts from within NetSuite.

Brands that use Conversational Cloud for sales and support can offer a more personalized, informed experience with access to NetSuite, by giving agents a full overview of the account, including previous or existing cases, opportunities and even potential leads. Through the Conversational Cloud NetSuite integration, agents can utilize the workspace to conduct all conversations with customers, and get instant access to pertinent information without having to open a separate browser window to manually check the NetSuite record. Agents can also search through records using the field from pre-chat surveys and/or through the widget.

Furthermore, agents have the ability to easily create records in NetSuite as part of the conversation (leads, opportunities, accounts, cases) and store the conversation transcript and additional info in the CRM after the engagement.
