The legacy LivePerson CRM widgets have been deprecated. For those still requiring services related to LivePerson's legacy CRM widgets, <a href="https://navomi.com/crm-connect/" target="_blank">NAVOMI</a> will provide the option of continued service and support at a fee starting October 15, 2022. For more information, please contact your CSM or Account Team.

This integration will allow you to see and create your Microsoft Dynamics Contact, Lead, Account record data right from within Conversational Cloud. It will also allow you to view your Conversational Cloud transcripts from within Microsoft Dynamics.

Brands that use Conversational Cloud for sales and support can offer a more personalized, informed experience with access to Microsoft Dynamics, by giving agents a full overview of the account, including previous or existing cases, opportunities and even potential leads. Through the Conversational Cloud Microsoft Dynamics integration, agents can utilize the workspace to conduct all conversations with customers, and get instant access to pertinent information without having to open a separate browser window to manually check the Microsoft Dynamics record. Agents can also search through records using the field from pre-chat surveys and/or through the widget.

Furthermore, agents have the ability to easily create records in Microsoft Dynamics as part of the conversation (leads, opportunities, accounts, cases) and store the conversation transcript and additional info in the CRM after the engagement.
