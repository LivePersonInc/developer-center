### Overview

Consumers prefer to message rather than call brands. However, in some cases, a higher touch interaction such as a video call can help to make the conversation more effective.

### Benefits of using video chat

* **Solve issues, the first time around**: video gives agents the best tools for achieving first contact resolution and reducing wait time and average hold time.

* **Build relationships with your customers**: video lets agents meaningfully connect with consumers they are already messaging with, fostering a more personal connection.

* **Flexibility in meeting consumer needs**: consumers expect to have the flexibility to do all types of communication in one place over chat. Now brands can meet their customerâ€™s expectations by providing them with chat and video all within one place, achieving the complete digital experience.

### Use cases

* Solve intricate tech support issues or inquiries that would be hard to describe without visuals. For example, guide a customer on resetting the wires on a modem.

* Provide your VIP customers with concierge, premium treatment.
Video provides tailored solutions and service for consumers, with their personal choices kept on priority.

* Replace in-person meetings such as consultations or long application process with real-time assistance and in-store experience.

* Identify consumers when verification is needed on personal and secure issues.
