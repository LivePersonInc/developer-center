The Conversational Cloud SMS solution provides brands with multiple entry points for their consumers.

The key to the best SMS experience for both brand and consumer is choosing the best entry point(s). Where is your consumer traffic? Are your consumers active in your app? Are your consumers busy calling a 1800 number? By choosing the best entry point(s) brands can ensure that SMS engagement will be an effective channel for meaningfully engaging with consumers.

This document is a comprehensive guide for all the Conversational Cloud SMS entry points. If you are interested in configuring a specific entry point, skip ahead to that specific section.
