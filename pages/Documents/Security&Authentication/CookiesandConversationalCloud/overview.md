A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored in the visitors' web browser. It helps the website to remember information about a visit; so when a visitor browses the same website in the future, the data stored in the cookie is sent back to the website by the browser.

Conversational Cloud uses information stored in browser storage to maintain session data and to identify returning visitors by saving Conversational Cloud-specific data, such as visitor ID and last chat date. It is important to note that the stored data **do not contain any private customer data** or any data that can be accessible or useful outside of Conversational Cloud.

### Cookie Consent

Brands that elect to use our products and services are responsible for obtaining (and maintaining) consumer consent before using Conversational Cloud cookies and other tracking technologies on their websites.  While we include suggested best practices below, we also recommend that you seek legal advice about what would be best for your particular websites or applications in light of your offering, the reason you’re using cookies and the laws that apply to you.

### Best Practices with Cookies and Conversational Cloud

In order to stay aligned with the latest regulations, LivePerson recommends that brands adopt the following best practices regarding cookies, tracking and Conversational Cloud:

1. You should add a cookie consent functionality to your website.  It should contain a prominent banner or similar visual element when the page first loads to concisely inform the consumer about the use of cookies and what action the consumer should take to consent.

  * If the consumer consents, you should remember their response so you can deploy the Web Tag on all subsequent visits and pages.

  * If the consumer declines, you should remember their response, so the Web Tag is **not** deployed on subsequent pages and visits. Additionally you may choose to refresh the current page to apply the consumer’s choice so that the Web Tag would not get deployed on that specific page.

2. You should include information about your use of third party cookies, such as Conversational Cloud cookies, and the purpose for their use, in your privacy policy or cookie notice.

3. You should inform consumers about various options they can use to disable cookies.

### Storage Data Types

<div class="attn-note">If no duration is specified for a Storage Type below, this means its duration is the browser session.</div>

**SecureStorage**

Secure storage is a client-side storage mechanism, that LivePerson has implemented in order to provide the best possible consumer experience. Secure storage uses a combination of modern browser technologies (indexedDB, localStorage, sessionStorage and first party cookies) to store necessary information on LivePerson domains — depending on browser capabilities.

By default, Conversational Cloud uses the third-party storage solution type for website visitors. If you have any questions about this approach, please contact LivePerson Customer Support. The following tables list the stored data and their types offered by LivePerson.

### Considerations

The following issues should be considered when working with Conversational Cloud Cookies.

#### Secure Cookies

Conversational Cloud supports secure cookies, but requires the Web Tag to be deployed using HTTPS.

#### HttpOnly Attribute

Conversational Cloud is unable to support the HttpOnly attribute because it does not operate through JavaScript, which enables the Web Tag to collect cookies.

#### Third Party Storage — Default

By default, Conversational Cloud uses third-party session and visitor storage in order to save visitors’ tracking information. This is due to the fact that while visitors are browsing your site, the Conversational Cloud cookies are set by the Conversational Cloud domain and not by your website domain.

Some browsers are currently limiting the usage of third-party storage — this can affect the LivePerson loading and monitoring process. it is possible also to enable first-party storage support for the secure storage for additional support.

If you have any questions that are not addressed through this cookie policy, please contact LivePerson Technical Support.
