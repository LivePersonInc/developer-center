This document covers the Conversational Cloud Categories backend logic and the capabilities and description of the Predefined Categories API. The purpose of Predefined Categories is to group LE **Predefined Content** elements by category in order to allow personalization of the userâ€™s experience. The API allows you to manipulate this grouping in order to edit, remove or create new Predefined Categories or retrieve information on single/multiple categories more easily.

### Getting Started

A few things you'll need to get started with this API:

1. **Retrieve your domain**. Use the [LivePerson Domain API](agent-domain-domain-api.html) to retrieve this information by providing the following service name:

    * Read only: accountConfigReadOnly

    * Read/Write: accountConfigReadWrite

2. This API requires authorization using _either_ a login or an API key methodology.

    * **Log a user into Conversational Cloud** using the [Login Service API](login-getting-started.html). Provide a username and password, and receive an authorization token (bearer). Use this token as your authorization header in all API requests.

    * [Follow the instructions](guides-gettingstarted.html), to create and use an API key.

3. Note the [API terms of use](https://www.liveperson.com/policies/apitou).

4. When using this API, it is recommended that you implement our [Retry Policy and KeepAlive best practices](guides-retry-policy.html).

### Authentication

This API supports both LP OAuth 1.0 and LP Access Token authentication patterns. More info about LP APIs authentication can be found [here](guides-gettingstarted.html).
