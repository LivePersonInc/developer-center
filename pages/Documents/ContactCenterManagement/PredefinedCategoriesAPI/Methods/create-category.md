### Request Headers

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Header</td>
    <td>Description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Authorization</td>
    <td>Contains token string to allow request authentication and authorization. See the doc for more details.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Request Body

The request body is able to accept single JSON object as shown below, or a JSON array [] of such objects.

Notes**:**

1. Order attribute is not mandatory. It is a sequential and consecutive value managed by the server.

2. If order is not passed and there are multiple items in the request, order assigned by the server is not guaranteed to be the sorting in the request body.

3. Sending categories to be created with duplicate order value results in a BAD_REQUEST response code.

4. Order value has to greater than zero. Failing this validation will result in a BAD_REQUEST response code.

5. Should you choose to pass order value, you may have order value collision with existing order resulting in a BAD_REQUEST response code.

Single category creation

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>{
             "deleted":false,
             "name":"iPhone4",
             "order":10,
             "proposed":true
}</td>
  </tr>
</table>

For the above body:

* if no categories exist, the newly created category is assigned order 1.

* if n categories exist, where n < 10, the newly created category is assigned order n + 1.

* if n categories exist, where n >= 10, order collision is detected  resulting in a BAD_REQUEST response code.

Multiple category creation

Note: order assigned by the server is not guaranteed to be the order in the request body

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>[{
    "deleted": false,
    "name": "A1",
    "proposed": false
},{
    "deleted": false,
    "name": "A2",
    "order": "10",
    "proposed": false
},{
    "deleted": false,
    "name": "A3",
    "proposed": false
}]</td>
  </tr>
</table>

For the above body:

* if no categories exist, category A2 is assigned order 1 and the other categories passing null orders are assigned order value of 2,3 randomly.

* if n categories exist, where n < 10, category A2 is assigned order n + 1 and the other categories passing null orders are assigned order value of n + 2, n + 3 randomly.

* if n categories exist, where n >= 10, order collision is detected  resulting in a BAD_REQUEST response code.
