### Introduction

The Agent Survey for Messaging, enables brands to categorize, qualify and collect feedback from agents about the conversation. Brands are using this information to optimize their operation: improve campaigns, train agent, reduce the need for transfer etc.
 
The Agent Survey is delivered in a dedicated widget, during the conversation, to drive higher completion rates and provide the agents with the best experience possible.

This API allows you to manipulate such Agent Surveys, by creating new ones, updating them or simply retrieving information on which Agent Surveys are available and their metadata.

### Getting Started

A few things you'll need to get started with this API:

1. **Retrieve your domain**. Use the [LivePerson Domain API](agent-domain-domain-api.html) to retrieve this information by providing the following service name:

	* Read only: accountConfigReadOnly

	* Read/Write: accountConfigReadWrite

2. This API requires authorization using _either_ a login or an API key methodology.

	* **Log a user into LiveEngage** using the [Login Service API](login-getting-started.html). Provide a username and password, and receive an authorization token (bearer). Use this token as your authorization header in all API requests.

	* [Follow the instructions](guides-gettingstarted.html), to create and use an API key.

3. Note the [API terms of use](https://www.liveperson.com/policies/apitou).

4. When using this API, it is recommended that you implement our [Retry Policy and KeepAlive best practices](guides-retry-policy.html).
