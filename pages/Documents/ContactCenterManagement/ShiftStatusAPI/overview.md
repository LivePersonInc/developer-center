This API allows clients to check whether the requested skill, or all skills of the account, are currently in an active shift â€” based on the skill's configuration (whether defined on the account level via the account shift scheduler or overriden by the skill's configuration).

### Getting Started

A few things you'll need to get started with this API:

1. **Retrieve your domain**. Use the [LivePerson Domain API](agent-domain-domain-api.html) to retrieve this information by providing the following service name: 

	* asyncMessagingEnt

2. This API requires authorization using _either_ a login or an API token methodology.

	* When fetching data using the API on the account level, you need to use the login methodology. **Log a user into Conversational Cloud** using the [Login Service API](login-getting-started.html). Provide a username and password, and receive an authorization token (bearer). Use this token as your authorization header in all API requests.

	* When fetching data using the API on the skill level, you need to use the API token methodology. **Use the Authentication API** (signup to LivePerson IDP URL) to pass the external token and get an API token (JWT). for e.g. https://{{idpDomain}}/api/account/{{accountId}}/signup to get the JWT. here idpDomain can be retrieved from [LivePerson Domain API](agent-domain-domain-api.html) and accountId is your Conversation Cloud account/site Id.
	
3. Note the [API terms of use](https://www.liveperson.com/policies/apitou).

4. When using this API, it is recommended that you implement our [Retry Policy and KeepAlive best practices](guides-retry-policy.html).
