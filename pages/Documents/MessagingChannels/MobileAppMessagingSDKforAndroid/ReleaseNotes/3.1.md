### Android Messaging SDK -  Version 3.1

These are the main feature releases available in the **Mobile App Messaging SDK version 3.1 for Android**.

**Version 3.1 planned roll-out: March 18h 2018**

[Version Specific System Requirements Document](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ce-sr/CA/Admin/Sys+req/System+requirements+v6.4.pdf)

#### New functionalities

##### Campaigns for Messaging - Monitoring APIs

**Type:** Developer Experience Feature

**Available to all customers?** Yes.

The addition of campaigns for mobile app and web messaging will allow brands to manage their engagements easily and efficiently across these channels, targeting customers based on unauthenticated attributes or locations and routing them to a desired skill.

Being able to track customer activity in all areas of the brand app and provide information on these interactions to Conversational Cloud boosts agent efficiency and enables more accurate reporting.

Using the Monitoring APIs, brands can:

1. Report on the customer’s journey inside the app

2. Get engagements based on the reported SDEs

3. Route conversations to a specific skill (based on engagements)

##### Monitoring APIs

The below APIs enable brands to use Campaigns for Messaging inside the brand’s app

<table>
<thead>
 <tr>
 <th>New APIs</th>
 <th> Description </th>
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
 <tr>
 <td>Added to Liveperson.initialize() →
InitLivePersonProperties contains new MonitoringInitParams object</td>
 <td>Added new optional MonitoringInitParams object. Brands who wish to use Monitoring capabilities and campaigns should add the required parameters.
The SDK can be initialized once without MonitoringInitParams and then have another initialize call using these params.
</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>CampaignInfo was added to ConversationViewParams (used in showConversation() and getConversationFragment())
</td>
 <td>Added new optional CampaignInfo object to be able to pass a new campaign information to conversation.
Campaign includes Engagement info which allows to control the consumer's routing.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>New BadArgumentException was added.
</td>
 <td>CampaignInfo has three mandatory members: campaignId, engagementId and engagementContextId. If constructing CampaignInfo with one of them null or empty BadArgumentException is thrown.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>getEngagement(Context context, @Nullable String consumerId, MonitoringParams monitoringParams, EngagementCallback callback)</td>
 <td>Use this API to get an engagement for a consumer in an appInstallationId context. When calculating eligibility the decision is based on the SDEs and other parameters. Based on messaging campaign concept
As an optional parameter, you can pass MontoringParams which includes PageId, Entry Points and Engagement Attributes for routing the conversation.
- Parameters:
      - context: application context
      - consumerID: an optional brand app consumer ID to get the engagement for
      - monitoringParams: an instance of includes optional PageId, JSONArray of Entry Points and a JSONArray of Engagement Attributes
      - EngagementCallback: operation callback:
    onSuccess() response with LPEngagementResponse that contains pageId, sessionId, visitorId and engagementDetailsList
   onError() response with the MonitoringErrorType</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>sendSde(Context context, @NonNull String consumerId, @NonNull MonitoringParams monitoringParams, SdeCallback callback)</td>
 <td>Use this API to report an engagement attributes (SDEs) for a consumer in an appInstallationId context.
- Parameters:
      - context: application context
      - consumerID: brand app consumer ID to get the engagement for
      - monitoringParams: an instance of LPMonitoringParams includes optional Array of Entry Points and an optional dictionary of Engagement Attributes. Additional optional parameter is PageID which is used for Page identification for sending events on the current engagement. PageID will be received in LPSdeResponse and in LPtEngagementResponse
    - SdeCallback: operation callback:
    onSuccess() response with LPSdeResponse that contains pageId, sessionId and visitorId
   onError() response with the MonitoringErrorType
</td>

**Please note: while the APIs are already available in the SDK, the backend will be available in mid-April. Please consult your account team before using the APIs.**

##### Conversation History Control

**Type:** Developer Experience Feature

**Available to all customers?** Yes.

To enhance control of customer data retention, scalability and performance, and support the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), open conversations will be loaded from a real time service while closed conversations will be loaded from a history service.

The change will be **seamless** for brands who upgrade to SDK version 3.1. Brands choosing not to upgrade to SDK v3.1 will be able to view the conversation history from the last 14 days. The history stored on the consumer’s device will also be available.

The following additional conditions and configurations are required:*

<table>

 <tr>
 <th>Backend update</th>
 <th>Backend enablement</th>
 <th>Backend configuration </th>
 <th>SDK enablement </th>
 <th>SDK configuration </th>

##### History and Active Conversation View

**Type:** Developer Experience Feature

**Available to all customers?** Yes.

New APIs will give brands control over the conversations presented in the conversation window. For example, brands can choose to present only the last 180 days of conversation history.

These APIs can be used together with getengagement (Monitoring APIs) to decide how to present  conversations history according to whether there is an open conversation or not. For example, if there is no open conversation, brands can present a ‘View conversation history’ button which will present only the closed conversations from the last 180 days.

The new APIs allows:

* Getting an indication if there is an open conversation or not (Monitoring APIs)

* Controlling which conversations will be presented by status (open\closed)

* Controlling the time frame of presented conversations (by days)

* When using historyConversationsMaxDays, LPConversationHistoryMaxDaysDateType will decide if to filter by the conversations' start date or end date. When not providing a value, startConversationDate will be the default.
