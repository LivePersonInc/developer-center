* SDK used an old authentication token, even when the consumer is passed a new auth token.

* User conversation system info (OS Type and Device) is not updated in Conversational Cloud when a consumer switches between IOS and Android.

* Unauthenticated consumers passing campaign info cannot connect successfully.

* Conversation close event has been added to be triggered when hideConversation() is called.
