### Android Messaging SDK — version 2.3
These are the main feature releases available in the **Mobile App Messaging SDK version 2.3 for Android**.

[Version Specific System Requirements Document](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ce-sr/CA/Admin/Sys+req/System+requirements+v5.6.pdf)

#### Presence enablement for photo sharing — beta

Presence enablement for photo sharing provides consumers with the ability to receive notifications while uploading a photo, whether they remain within the app or keep it running in the background. The Web Socket remains open for a maximum of 5 seconds when the app moves to the background. This scenario is also applicable for non photo sharing flows.

In addition, brands can also customize notifications for photo sharing, indicating to the consumer when a photo is loading, has successfully sent or has failed to send

Related strings: Photo sharing upload status

#### In-app unread messages badge enablement

When there are unread messages waiting for the consumer within the brand app, this information can be pushed to display in the app’s notification badge. Within the app, brands can develop their own visualisation of a badge, such as a number, icon or other marker to show unread messages.

#### Secure form for Mobile App Messaging

The secure form gives consumers the confidence to submit sensitive information, such as credit card data and social security numbers, while messaging in-app. The form also enables agents to safely carry out secure processes, such as payment, identification and authorisations. The form can be tailored to match the Mobile App Messaging experience and has a time-out expiry, for added security.

_This feature requires consulting services support. For more information, please refer to the Conversational Cloud [secure form for messaging documentation](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ce-sr/CA/security/Secure+form+for+messaging.pdf)_.

#### New APIS

**handlePushMessage**

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| context | A context from the host app. |
| data | A Bundle that contains the message. The bundle should hold a string with key named "message". |
| brandId | The account ID. |
| showNotification | Used to instruct the SDK to either show or not show a notification to the user. If you wish your app will handle the display of the notification you can set this as false. |

All incoming push messages are received by the host app. The host app can choose to fully handle any push message and display a notification message, or partially handle it and allow the SDK to display the notification. In a case the host app decides to show its own custom notification, it can call handlePushMessage() with the showNotification parameter set to false and will parse and return a PushMessage object. In case the push message is not related to the SDK, it will return null.

_Note: For the unread messages feature to work correctly, the host app must call this method upon receiving SDK push messages (whether showing a custom notification or not)._

**getNumUnreadMessages**

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| brandId | The account ID. |

This returns the counter of the unread messages to the number of push messages received.
This number is set to 0 when opening the conversation screen.

To get updates on the unread messages counter: create a BroadcastReceiver that will listen to the following Action:

_LivePerson.ACTION_LP_UPDATE_NUM_UNREAD_MESSAGES_ACTION;_

To get the number of unread messages out of the intent, use the following extra key:

_LivePerson.ACTION_LP_UPDATE_NUM_UNREAD_MESSAGES_EXTRA;_

**Photo Sharing**

Set a pending intent for the image upload foreground service notification -

`setImageServicePendingIntent(PendingIntent pendingIntent)`

Set a notification builder for the image upload foreground service notification -

`setImageServiceUploadNotificationBuilder(Notification.Builder builder)`

Set a notification builder for the image down foreground service notification -

`setImageServiceDownloadNotificationBuilder(Notification.Builder builder)`

#### Deprecated API

The following API has been deprecated:

`public static void handlePush(Context context, Bundle data, String brandId, boolean
showNotification)`

Please use the above handlePushMessage() method instead.
