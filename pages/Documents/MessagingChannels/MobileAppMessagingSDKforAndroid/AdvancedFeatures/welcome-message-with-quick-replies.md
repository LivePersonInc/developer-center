**Supported versions:** 3.8 and newer

When a consumer starts a new conversation, or a new customer visits the site, brands can send the first message with a list of quick replies of common intents.

You can configure the Welcome message as a simple text message with or without quick replies, for example:

> *Welcome to our support! What can we help you with today?*
>
> *[Questions about existing account] [open a new account] [tech support]*

A consumerâ€™s quick reply selection or answer gets inserted as their first message in the conversation, which opens the conversation in the Conversational Cloud Agent Workspace.

### How to enable

```java
LPWelcomeMessage lpWelcomeMessage = new LPWelcomeMessage("Welcome Message");
new ConversationViewParams().setLpWelcomeMessage(lpWelcomeMessage); // june 12 2019: new - needs validated
List<MessageOption> optionItems = new ArrayList<>();
optionItems.add(new MessageOption("bill", "bill"));
optionItems.add(new MessageOption("sales", "sales"));
optionItems.add(new MessageOption("support", "support"));
try {
       lpWelcomeMessage.setMessageOptions(optionItems);
} catch (Exception e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
}
lpWelcomeMessage.setNumberOfItemsPerRow(8);
lpWelcomeMessage.setMessageFrequency(LPWelcomeMessage.MessageFrequency.EVERY_CONVERSATION);
conversationViewParams.setLpWelcomeMessage(lpWelcomeMessage);
LivePerson.showConversation(Activity, LPAuthenticationParams, conversationViewParams);

```

If set empty String in constructor `LPWelcomeMessage(String welcomeMessage)`, the welcome message with quick reply feature will be disabled. It shows the default welcome message, which is set up in the String resources `lp_first_message`.

There are two parameters in the `MessageOption` class constructor.

```java
public MessageOption(@NonNull String displayText, @NonNull String value)
```

- **displayText** is the text displayed in the quick reply button.
- **value** is the content that is sent to the agent. Default value is `displayText` if set to empty String.

There are two message frequencies:
- **FIRST_TIME_CONVERSATION:** Shows the welcome message for first conversation only.
- **EVERY_CONVERSATION:** Shows welcome a message for every new conversation.

### Limitations

- You can configure up to 24 quick reply options for the user to chose.

- You have a maximum of 25 characters for your title, but anything over displays an ellipsis after the 22nd  character.  When building your client, you have control over the character limit for the title.

- Once you set `itemsPerRow` (max 8), the number of rows calculate automatically (up to 3 rows). If the number of replies exceeds `itemsPerRow` times 3, the extra replies get added to the last row.

- When the consumer ends the conversation, the window remains open, and the Welcome message appears again. The message frequency should be set to `EVERY_CONVERSATION`.

- Quick reply messages do not get recorded in the conversation history.

- The conversational metadata (ExternalId) does not get populated.

   ```
   "metadata": [
   {
   "type": "ExternalId",
   "id": "Yes-1234"
   }
   ]
   ```
