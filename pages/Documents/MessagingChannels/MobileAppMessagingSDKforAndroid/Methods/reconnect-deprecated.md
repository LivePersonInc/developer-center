*This method was deprecated - please use [reconnect(LPAuthenticationParams)](android-reconnectfull.html).*

Reconnect with a new authentication key. When connecting with an authentication key, the connection may be closed once the token is expired. When this happens, the [onTokenExpired](android-callbacks-index.html) callback method is called. In this case, the application needs to obtain a fresh key and reconnect by calling the reconnect method.

`public static void reconnect(String authKey)`

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| authKey | The authentication key  |
