### Initializing the SDK

This method initializes the SDK.

```swift
//Basic initializer, the default minimumLogLevel will be .info.
LPABCSDK.initialize()

//Initializer with explicit log level
LPABCSDK.initialize(minimumLogLevel: .trace)

//For disabling logs use LPABCLogLevel.none
LPABCSDK.initialize(minimumLogLevel: .none)

//Use 'eventSubscription' for passing the events 'LPABCEvent' you wish to get a callback notification for. 
//If not explicitly stated, the default would be subscribing to all events.
LPABCSDK.initialize(minimumLogLevel: .none, eventSubscription: [.newConversation])

//To disable events notification use 'LPABCEvent.noEvents'
LPABCSDK.initialize(eventSubscription: LPABCEvent.noEvents)
```

### Update the SDK with Incoming CIM

Upon an agent sending a [Custom Interactive Message (CIM)](apple-business-chat-templates-custom-interactive-message-template.html) to the consumer, this method will update the SDK with a payload that will enable SDE reporting to Conversational Cloud.

```swift
func update(with conversation: MSConversation, message: MSMessage? = nil, abcsdkParams: ABCSDKParams? = nil)

```

- `message` sould be used where available and returned by the override method.

- `ABCSDKParams` is optional and should be used for passing references to the sdk. Should be used in `didBecomeActive` and `didSelect`.

Should be implemented from these override functions in the iMessage app extension `MSMessagesAppViewController`:

- `didBecomeActive(with conversation: MSConversation)`
- `didSelect(_ message: MSMessage, conversation: MSConversation)`
- `didReceive(_ message: MSMessage, conversation: MSConversation)`

See [step 6 of Installation for more](apple-business-chat-sdk-installation.html#sdk-installation-in-xcode).

### Create SDEs

When you create one or more SDEs, they get added to a dedicated stack.

The `createSDE` function generates and calls back an SDEBase object with a template of the relevant SDE type as its property, which then needs to implement a 'setup' function.

Pass in the [SDE type](engagement-attributes-types-of-engagement-attributes.html) that you want, and it will return an SDEBase object containing an instantiated property of the relevant SDE template object.

All dependent schema objects could be initiated and passed in as arguments to the SDE setup

Inside of the completion callback, on the sde setup method, it is required to define the relevant params to initiate the sde.

Example 1:

```swift
lpabcsdk.createSDE(sdeType: .visitorError) { (sdeBase) in
    sdeBase.visitorError?.setup(
        contextId: "<CONTEXID>",
        message: "<MESSAGE>",
        code: "<CODE>",
        level: 0,
        resolved: true
    )
}
```

Example 2:

```swift
lpabcsdk.createSDE(sdeType: .cartUpdate) { (sdeBase) in
    //Create a product:
    let product = SDEProduct.init(
        name: "<>",
        category: "<>",
        sku: "<>",
        price: 100,
        quantity: 3
    )

    //Setup the sde:
    sdeBase.cartUpdate?.setup(
        total: 100,
        currency: "<>",
        numItems: 1,
        products: [product]
    )
}
```

The SDE `setup` call could also be created using 'UnifiedLooseSDE' protocol, as **json** string or **Dictionary** object:

Example:

```swift
sdeBase.setupWithJson("{\"type\":\"ctmrinfo\"}")
sdeBase.setupWithJson(["type":"cart"])
```

#### Auto Send Aggregated Stack

The optional `aggregate` parameter, when set to true, will add the sde to the **aggregateStack** which will get **sent automatically** once the [aggregation stack timeout](#Aggregated-SDE-Stack-Timeout) is met. Default is 5 sec but could be anything between 1-15 sec. See `setAggregatedInterval(interval:)`

Example:

```swift
lpabcsdk.createSDE(sdeType: .customerInfo, aggregate: true) { (sdeBase) in
    sdeBase.customerInfo?.setup(
        cstatus: "<cstatus>",
        ctype: "<ctype>",
        balance: 10,
        currency: "<currency>",
        socialId: "<socialId>",
        imei: "<imei>",
        userName: "<userName>",
        companySize: 30,
        companyBranch: "<companyBranch>",
        accountName: "<accountName>",
        role: "<role>",
        loginStatus: 0,
        storeZipCode: "<storeZipCode>",
        storeNumber: "<storeNumber>",
        lastPaymentDate: SDEDate.init(
            day: 23,
            month: 4,
            year: 2019
        ),
        registrationDate: nil
    )
}
```

### Sending SDE

In order to **manually** send the SDE Stack, use the following:

```swift
lpabcsdk.sendSDEStack()

// or using completion callbacks:
lpabcsdk.sendSDEStack(onSuccess: { (success) in
    // success closure
}) { (error) in
    // error closure
}
```

You can use `isCacheLoaded` in order to get the SDK's cache state, which is retrieveable via CIM (per each new conversation), and is required for enabling SDE reporting.

### Aggregated SDE Stack Timeout

This will setup a timeout interval for auto sending the aggregated SDE stack (optional). Default is 5 seconds and Max is 15.

```swift
lpabcsdk.setAggregatedInterval(interval:15)
```

See the [Auto Send aggregated](#Auto-Send-Aggregated) optional parameter in [Create SDEs](#create-sdes).

### Aggregated SDE Stack Send Completion Closure

If you want to execute code whenever the Aggregated SDE Stack auto send completes, implement the `aggregatedSDEStackCompletion` closure:

```swift
lpabcsdk.aggregatedSDEStackCompletion = {  completion, error in
    // debug code
}
```

### Event Callback

Some consumer actions can trigger meaningful events (eg. a new conversation starts, secure form completion, etc.). If you would like to act upon, or send an SDE once a subscribed event has been triggered, you can do so by implenting the `abcEventCallback` closure.

```swift
lpabcsdk.abcEventCallback = { event  in
    // implement
}
```

- `LPABCEvent` - Indicates the type of event that is being called back from the abcEventCallback.

- `abcEventCallback` - Invoked when a qualifying subscribed event is met, and callback the type of that event

You can set the desired SDEs to express your custom reporting for the event triggered.

**Supported Event Types**:

- `newConversation`: Receiving an **incoming (agent to consumer)**, new first time CIM — per conversation.
- `secureForm`: Receiving an **incoming (agent to consumer)** secure form — see the [Secure Form documentation](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/security-regulations-secure-forms-secure-forms-for-messaging-user-guide.html).

Example:

```swift
lpabcsdk.abcEventCallback = { eventType in
    switch eventType {
        case .newConversation:
            // Create and send desired SDE
             break
        case .secureForm(.submitted):
            // Create and send desired SDE
            break
         case .custom:
            //Accsess your custom payload embedded in CIM URL.
            break
    }
}
```

### Reply CIM from Consumer to Agent

An agent can recieve back from the consumer a Custom Interactive Message with contextual text. This text can be displayed to the agent in the Agent Workspace.

For example, if the consumer selects a product inside of your iMessage app, the Agent can see which product they selected via the `textContext` of this method.

```swift
// create MSMessage object

lpabcsdk.appendReplayMessagePayload(message: MSMessage, textContext: String)

// send MSMessage object
```

Pass in the initiated MSMessage object, and the desired textual String.

### Synchronize SDK (Host app target feature)

When called, the SDK will explicitly sync with the latest cache version.

The best practice will be to add this to your AppDelegate/ applicationWillEnterForeground, in order to use the monitoring ability when the host app enters the foreground.

An iMesssage extension target will have no effect calling this function.

```swift
func applicationWillEnterForeground(_ application: UIApplication) {
    LPABCSDK.synchronize()
}
```
