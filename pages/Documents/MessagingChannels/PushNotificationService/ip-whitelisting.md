### IP Whitelisting

To ensure that your communications infrastructure doesnâ€™t block communication from the Conversational Cloud push service, you'll need to whitelist the LivePerson IP ranges.

The complete list of IP ranges can be found [here](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/security-regulations-security-configuring-your-firewall.html).

**_Note: the Conversational Cloud push service works over standard port 443. Make sure that you enable connections to this port._**
