### IP Whitelisting

To ensure that your communications infrastructure doesn’t block communication from the Conversational Cloud push service, you'll need to whitelist the LivePerson IP ranges.

The complete list of IP ranges can be found [here](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/security-regulations-security-configuring-your-firewall.html).

**_Note: the Conversational Cloud push service works over standard port 443. Make sure that you enable connections to this port_**.
