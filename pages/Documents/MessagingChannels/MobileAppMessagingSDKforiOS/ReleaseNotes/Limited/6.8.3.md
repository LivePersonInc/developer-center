How to use:

```swift
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self,
                                       selector: #selector(lpMessagingSDKConversationViewControllerDidDismissedNotification),
                                       name: Notification.Name("LP_CONVERSATION_VIEW_CONTROLLER_DISMISSED"),
                                       object: nil)
```

> *lpMessagingSDKConversationViewControllerDidDismissedNotification* is a generic name for the function responding to the event
