**Release Date**: January 22, 2020 

#### Environment requirements

The iOS Mobile Messaging SDK version 5.1.1 is supported on iOS versions 11 through 13. It is available on Swift version 5.1.3 (swiftlang-1100.0.282.1 clang-1100.0.33.15), and Swift version 5.1.2 (swiftlang-1100.0.278 clang-1100.0.33.9).   

#### Bugs fixed

* Fixed issue were CSAT was appearing for auto closed conversations

#### New features

* If the user has denied access before for Audio, Photos, or Camera, the SDK now shows an alert upon usage informing the user that access can be enabled in the settings app.

The message, title, and options buttons for this alert can be customized by updating the values of the LPLocalizable.strings for the keys matching below.

`permissionPopUpDeniedOptionNotNow`
`permissionPopUpDeniedOptionGoToSettings`
`permissionPopUpDeniedTitle`

`permissionPopUpDeniedMicrophoneDescription`
`permissionPopUpDeniedCameraDescription`
`permissionPopUpDeniedPhotoLibraryDescription`

`permissionPopUpRestrictedTitle`
`permissionPopUpRestrictedDescription`
