The iOS Mobile Messaging SDK version 5.1.1 is supported on iOS versions 11 through 13. It is avaliable on Swift version 5.1.3 (swiftlang-1100.0.282.1 clang-1100.0.33.15), and Swift version 5.1.2 (swiftlang-1100.0.278 clang-1100.0.33.9).   

#### Bugs fixed

The message, title, and options buttons for this alert can be customized by updating the values of the LPLocalizable.strings for the keys matching below.
