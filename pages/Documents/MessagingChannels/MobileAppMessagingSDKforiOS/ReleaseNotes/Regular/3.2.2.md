### Version 3.2.2
#### iOS Messaging SDK

iOS Messaging SDK v3.2.2 contains the following bug fixes:

#### Symptom

When calling getEngagement while there is an active conversation which is not related to a campaign, the response returns an error.

#### Fix

When calling getEngagement while there is an active conversation which is not related to a campaign, a response will be returned with the available information.

#### Symptom

In some cases, the badge counter was returned with an incorrect value, which represents a previous value. For example, when an agent sent messages while the conversation screen was in the background.

#### Fix

Badge counter is now showing the actual value.

#### Symptom

In case of a failure in ‘logout’, the user’s data might be displayed with empty message bubbles the next time that the consumer opens the conversation screen.

#### Fix

The user’s data is now cleared as expected only if the ‘logout’ succeeded.

#### Symptom

In some cases, the badge counter was returned with an incorrect value, which represents a previous value.

#### Fix

Badge counter is now showing the actual value regardless the state of the conversation.
