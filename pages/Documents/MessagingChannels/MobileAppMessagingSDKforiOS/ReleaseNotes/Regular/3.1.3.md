### Version 3.1.3
#### iOS Messaging SDK

Version 3.1.0.23 — Supports Xcode 9.2
Version 3.1.3 — Supports Xcode 9.3

The version contains the following bug fixes:

#### Symptom

When a consumer scrolls inside the conversation window, returns to the app and then back to the conversation, their position inside the screen is not saved and they need to navigate back to their previous position.

#### Fix

The consumer’s position within the conversation window is saved. When the consumer returns to the conversation, they will return to the same place they were when they navigated away from the screen.

#### Symptom

In some cases, when fetching additional history, the UI of the conversation screen breaks.

#### Fix

The UI will maintain its structure after fetching additional history.

#### Symptom

When a consumer starts a conversation and leaves the messaging screen while moving the app to background, then returns to the messaging screen after the JWT has expired, they will not be able to continue the conversation and sending messages will be disabled.

#### Fix

The JWT expiration is now verified before each socket connection. If it expires, a callback of tokenExpired will be invoked.

#### Symptom

When calling the API of removeConversation() from viewWillDisappear() when the conversation has been resolved, the socket will be closed while the CSAT is being presented to the consumer. As a result, the CSAT submit button is disabled.

#### Fix

The socket will not be closed while the CSAT is being presented.
