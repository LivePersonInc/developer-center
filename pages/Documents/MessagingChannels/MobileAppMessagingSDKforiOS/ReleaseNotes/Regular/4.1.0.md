#### New feature

##### File sharing from consumer to agent

Mobile Messaging SDK v4.1 improves upon the current consumer photo sharing feature.

Consumers can now share information via files with agents such as documents, transaction details and others. This can provide agents with the info they need in order to better help the consumer. Consumers can also download files from resolved conversations.

The iOS SDK supports previewing all the supported file types on the device as per the iOS operating system by tapping on the thumbnail image.

#### Support for Bitcode is Enabled
The LivePerson SDK no longer requires Bitcode to be 'Disabled'.

#### Supported document formats from consumer to agent

- PDF
- DOCX
- PPTX
- XLSX

#### Photo and file sizes

- Thumbnail — 30 KB (base64-encoded)
- Max upload size allowed — 5 MB uncompressed

Any file larger than 5 MB selected from document picker will trigger an alert view:
<img loading="lazy" src="/img/ios-fs-size-limit-alert-view-screen-shot.png" alt="File limit alert view" style="width: 600px;padding: 20px;">

#### Notes and limitations

- Both photo sharing and file sharing are two way in SDK version 4.1 (agent-to-consumer and consumer-to-agent)

- If an attempt to view a photo or file is unsuccessful, an error icon covers the thumbnail. Upon retry, the file attempts to download again. Retry can be attempted as many times as possible (in case of a poor network) until the file is downloaded successfully.

- The consumer can return to a resolved conversation to view the photos, as long as the photos are part of the conversation history.

- For authenticated users, backgrounding the app while uploading the photo does not get interrupted.

- For unauthenticated sessions, consumers must tap the photo again with each visit because the history gets cleared when a session expires or logs the consumer out.

- For app running on iOS version 10.3 or lower with iCloud capability, file sharing from iOS SDK will use iCloud folder as file provider.

- For app running on iOS version 10.3 or lower without iCloud capability, file sharing from iOS SDK will be disabled (The entry point of file sharing will be hidden.)

- For app running on iOS version 11 or higher, file sharing from iOS SDK will use native Files app as file provider.

#### Known issue

1. When the files number exceed the maxNumberOfSavedDocumentsOnDisk. The SDK will deletes random files to keep the document number within maxNumberOfSavedDocumentsOnDisk (Expected behavior is to delete the oldest ones.)
2. Attachment button accessbilityLabel is not updated accordingly.
