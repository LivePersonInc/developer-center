### Version 3.2.3
#### iOS Messaging SDK

iOS Messaging SDK v3.2.3 contains the following bug fix:

#### Symptom

When a consumer tried to enter into an existing conversation after the agent marked it as closed, loading the history failed and the consumer couldn't see the conversation window.

#### Fix

The SDK will now clear the notification and history manager when logging out. This will cause removal of empty conversations from previous sessions and loading the history will fetch only relevant conversations.
