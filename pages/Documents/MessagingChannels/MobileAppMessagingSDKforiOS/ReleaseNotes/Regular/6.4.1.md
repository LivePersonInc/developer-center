#### iOS Messaging SDK

**Release Date**: June 9, 2021

##### Environment requirements

The iOS Mobile Messaging SDK version 6.4.1.791 is supported on iOS versions 12 through 14. 

**This XCFramework was compiled with Swift version 5.2.4 (swiftlang-1103.0.32.9 clang-1103.0.32.53) which means it will work Swift version 5.2.4 and above.**

#### Enhancements

Enhancing processing of Proactive and IVR Deflection to cover In App Notifications

Enabling processing of Proactive and IVR Deflection Notifications can be done using a new configuration, for cases when Host App is in an active state and consumer taps on the InApp Notification:

```swift
enableInAppProcessingForActiveState = true
```

Exposing a new method to handle tapping of InApp Notifications:

```swift
public func handleTapForInAppNotification(notification: LPNotification)
```

When brands have their own implementation of the LPMessagingSDK InApp notification via
`LPMessagingSDKNotification(customLocalPushNotificationView notification: LPNotification)` protocol, a new method has been exposed to notify SDK that notification was tapped and it can process the Proactive and IVR Deflection Data accordingly.

#### Bugs fixed

- Fixed the issue when Socket wonâ€™t disconnect when interrupting the connection process.
- Fixed the issue when loading view won't dismiss when closing and reopening Conversation Screen during PCS
