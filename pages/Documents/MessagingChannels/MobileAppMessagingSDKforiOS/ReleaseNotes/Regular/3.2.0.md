### Version 3.2.0
#### iOS Messaging SDK

**Version 3.2 roll-out: July 1st 2018**

#### Main Features

##### Audio Messaging

**Type**: Consumer Experience Feature
**Available to all customers?** No. Please contact your account team.

Consumers are now able to send Audio messages to brands which makes the communication even better.

In Audio messages, the Brands can configure:

1. The maximum length of the message (15 seconds - 2 minutes long by default)
2. Enable/Disable the feature
3. Max stored audio messages on device
4. Tooltips text

##### Unauthenticated In-App Messaging

**Type:** Developer Experience Feature

**Available to all customers?** Yes.

Brands can communicate with their consumers in an unauthenticated manner while being able to leverage additional Conversational Cloud capabilities such as Campaigns for Messaging.

Unauthenticated messaging allows brands to:

1. Easier and quicker on-boarding to Conversational Cloud

2. Having pre authentication messaging use cases, for example, assistance with password recovery

3. The ability to use Campaigns while having unauthenticated conversations

##### Quick Replies

**Type:** Consumer Experience Feature

**Available to all customers?** Yes.

Quick Replies enrich the consumer experience by using rich text interactions that guide the consumer throughout the conversation. The consumer is presented with a number of brief answers that can be selected in order to navigate the conversation in the right path.

The Quick Replies can contain the same actions as Structured Content buttons:

1. Publish text

2. Link

3. Navigation

As Quick Replies contain predefined values, the feature can dramatically improvie communication with Bots and improve both consumer experience and operational efficiency.

##### Structured Content Carousel

**Type:** Consumer Experience Feature

**Available to all customers?** Yes.

Structured Content experience is enriched with the Carousel allowing more capabilities, more use cases and moving agents one step forward in being able to provide end to end assistance.

The Carousel consists of more than one card at a time, side by side and the consumer can swipe between cards.

##### Experience and Branding Enhancements

**Type:** Consumer Experience Feature

**Available to all customers?** Yes.

The SDK allows Brands to customize the SDK even more, giving a personal touch to their cusomers.

**Large Emojis**

When using Emojis in a conversation:

1. One Emoji - the Emoji will be enlarged to an extra large size.

2. Two Emojis - the Emojis will be enlarged to a Large size.

3. More than two Emojis or Emojis with text - the Emojis' size will be small.

**Conversation Window Background Image**

A new way for Brands to set their own background in conversations to add a more personal touch.
