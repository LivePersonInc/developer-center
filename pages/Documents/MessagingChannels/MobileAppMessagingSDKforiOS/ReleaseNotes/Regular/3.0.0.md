### Version 3.0.0
#### iOS Messaging SDK

#### New functionalities

##### Certificate Pinning

**Type:** Security Feature

**Available to all customers?** No. Contact support for more details.

Certificate Pinning allows increased security on top of the commonly used SSL protocol for mobile apps. It assists to prevent certificate hijacks and mitigates implications from compromised certificate authorities. By using Certificate Pinning, apps have an additional validation of the server’s certificate.

The object certPinningPublicKeys was added to the object LPAuthenticationParams.
**Please note**: using the new object without completing the onborading process will result in failures while trying to communicate with LivePerson’s servers.

The following additional conditions and configurations are required:

| Backend update | Backend enablement | Backend configuration | SDK enablement | SDK configuration |
