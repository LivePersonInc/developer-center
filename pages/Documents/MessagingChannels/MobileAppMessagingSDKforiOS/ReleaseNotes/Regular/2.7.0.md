#### New functionalities

##### Structured content enablement (Beta)

**This version of the SDK delivers structured content enablement only; the feature will be made fully productive in October.*

**Description**
Structured message templates and elements, such as cards, images and deep linking buttons, turn a simple app interaction into a conversational user experience. They support a huge variety of messaging interactions and enable:

 - Clearer communication with bots, so commands are more easily
   understood.
 - The ability to trigger actions, such as deep-linking navigation,
   confirmations and transactions, directly from a conversation
 - Improved sales through product promotion and simplification of the
   purchasing process
 - An overall improved and more efficient service — just what
   consumers expect from messaging

**SDK 2.7 structured content capabilities**
Structured content capabilities are being gradually rolled out during September-October 2017.
Dedicated documentation for structured content will be published as part of the gradual rollout.

Mobile App Messaging SDK v2.7 has a structured content renderer for the following elements:

 - Image
 - Text
 - Button
 - Clicks (actions and meta-data)

Full list of elements dictionary will be published during the gradual rollout.

**What does enablement mean?**
Until rollout is complete, the structured content capability in SDK v2.7 is flagged as a Beta feature. The feature has an enablement toggle in the SDK which is disabled by default.

The toggle may be switched on as part of the SDK release within the host app, however it is highly recommended not to release the SDK in the host app with structured content enabled until end to end flow has been fully tested on the brand’s account.

In addition to structured content enablement, SDK v2.7 also has a few branding properties and one callback which can be configured and used.

##### Tablet split-screen supportability
To ensure that consumers using tablets can connect with brands while enjoying the tablet experience, brands can enable tablet applications to host the conversation window within an application page, as a fragment for Android or viewcontroller for iOS.

Until now the SDK has provided support for a full page layout for messaging conversations. SDK 2.7 provides full support for conversations in a split-screen with viewcontroller / fragment modes. Brands can own the wrapper and host the conversation in split-screen.

A full list of supported and certified devices can be found in the Conversational Cloud System Requirements document.

| N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

##### Connectivity status bar
The connectivity status bar ensures consumers are always kept informed about the status of their connection, including:

 - Online/ Offline status
 - Attempting to connect to Conversational Cloud service
 - Continuing attempt to connect to Conversational Cloud service
 - Retry

##### Secure form branding enhancements
To enable brands to adjust the secure form visuals to accurately reflect their brand experience, the following configurations are now available:

 - Secure form fonts
 - Bubble loader indicator color

The secure form is essentially a web page running in a web view, within the messaging conversation. As such, the web page may run predefined fonts which can be set by the SDK remotely.

By default, the font is set to Helvetica. However brands can choose from any of the fonts on the following secure form supported fonts list:

Aria, Arial, Arial Black, Bookman Old Style, Comic Sans MS, Courier New, Garamond, Georgia, Helvetica, HelveticaNeue, HelveticaNeue-Light, Impact, Lato, Lucida Console, Lucida Sans Unicode, MS Sans Serif, MS Serif, Palatino Linotype, Tahoma, Times New Roman, Trebuchet MS, Verdana.

##### Message selection
When the consumer selects a message with a long tap, the background color of the message will change, to indicate to the user that it has been selected.
The color of the selected message can be configured by the brand.

##### App level DB encryption
To protect and encrypt conversation data in DB on the application level, Jailbroken iPhone conversation data in DB is now protected with an app level key for encryption. Every message is now encrypted and decrypted in RunTime.

The following additional conditions and configurations are required*:

| Backend update | Backend enablement | Backend configuration | SDK enablement | SDK configuration |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

##### View-only mode
The SDK now offers a new RunTime mode in addition to the edit mode, known as view-only mode. View-only mode means consumers can see the full conversation, but the keyboard and text input area are not displayed. In this mode, new messages can arrive, but the consumer will not be able to respond.
This mode gives brands greater control over how consumers are able to use messaging within the brand’s app.
Future SDKs will support additional modes.

The following additional conditions and configurations are required*:

| Backend update | Backend enablement | Backend configuration | SDK enablement | SDK configuration |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | Yes |

##### Photo sharing permissions callback
When a consumer shares photos during a conversation, a banner appears asking them to grant permission for the app to have access to their camera and/ or photo library.

If the consumer refuses permission, the SDK sends a callback to the host app. Brands are then able to run a customized and branded banner with a second request for the consumer to grant the appropriate photo sharing permissions.

In order to present a custom banner, brands can create and present a new UIAlertViewController as well as a UIView, and present them on the SDK container ViewController or the root UIWindow.

#### New classes
##### LPConversationViewParams
This class represents an object to determine the conversation mode, filter and container, for example, Container, Window or ViewOnly.

    class LPConversationViewParams: NSObject {
     	var conversationQuery: ConversationParamProtocol!
        var containerViewController: UIViewController? // nil = WindowMode
     	var isViewOnly = false
    }

##### LPAuthenticationParams
This class represents an object to determine the properties of an authenticated connection. If using an authenticated connection, this parameter must be passed: LPAuthenticationParams supports Code Flow login or Implicit Flow login. For Implicit Flow, pass 'jwt' parameter only. For Code Flow, pass 'authCode' and 'redirectURI' only.

    class LPAuthenticationParams: NSObject {
        var authenticationCode: String? // Code Flow authentication
        var jwt: String? // Implicit Flow authentication
     	var redirectURI: String? // Code Flow authentication
    }

#### New APIs
##### View-only API

    func showConversation(_ conversationViewParams: LPConversationViewParams, authenticationParams: LPAuthenticationParams? = nil)

This method is used to open the conversation screen.

##### New reconnect API

    func reconnect(_ conversationQuery: ConversationParamProtocol, authenticationParams: LPAuthenticationParams

When using SSO in an authenticated connection, an auth-code is passed to the SDK. The session in this case might have an expiration date. To reconnect with a new token, use the 'reconnect’ API and pass the new token.

This method reconnects the conversation's connection for a conversation query and reconnects open related webSockets and sync the conversation with its latest updates.

#### Deprecated APIs
```
  func showConversation(_ conversationQuery: ConversationParamProtocol, authenticationCode: String? = nil, containerViewController: UIViewController? = nil)
```
This method has been deprecated in SDK version 2.7.
Use showConversation(_ conversationViewParams: LPConversationViewParams, authenticationParams: LPAuthenticationParams? = nil)

```
    func reconnect(_ conversationQuery: ConversationParamProtocol, authenticationCode: String)
```

This method was deprecated since SDK version 2.7.0.
Use reconnect(_ conversationQuery: ConversationParamProtocol, authenticationParams: LPAuthenticationParams]
