#### New features

* **New Logging subsystem**: New Logging subsystem, which introduces:

  - Data Masking feature ensures no sensitive consumer data can be leaked through system logs, even if they're set to Verbose. Head over [to Logging](mobile-app-messaging-sdk-for-ios-advanced-features-logging.html) to find out more.
* **Playback for Voice messages**: Audio messages can now be stopped and previewed before sending them.
* **Scroll to bottom button**: The width of the "scroll to bottom" button will be auto adjusted based on length of a message text. The button width can be auto adjusted up to half of the device's screen size. This is applicable for both portrait as well as landscape mode.
* **Push registration**: Improved Unread Message Count
  - Get the count of unread messages that are not yet received by the consumer's device. This API returns the count through the provided callback which is a sum of unread messages in the  open as well as closed conversation messages.
  - When there are unread messages waiting for the consumer within the brand app, this information can be pushed to display in the appâ€™s notification badge. Within the app, brands can develop their own visualization of a badge, such as a number, icon or other marker to show unread messages.
  - This API method uses a threshold mechanism of 10 seconds. If this API is called within 10 seconds from the last request was made, the counter will be returned from SDK cache otherwise a new request to the server will be made to fetch the latest count. 
  - Two new APIs ([getUnreadMessagesCount](mobile-app-messaging-sdk-for-ios-sdk-apis-messaging-api.html#getunreadmessagescount) and [isRegisteredForPushNotifications](mobile-app-messaging-sdk-for-ios-sdk-apis-messaging-api.html#isregisteredforpushnotifications)) introduced.
  - Two getUnreadMessagesCount APIs deprecated. For more information, please check [Messaging APIs](mobile-app-messaging-sdk-for-ios-sdk-apis-messaging-api.html) in the Deprecated methods.
  * **New LPConversationsHistoryStateToDisplay**: Add a new enum value (all) for LPConversationsHistoryStateToDisplay. Head over [to Messaging API](mobile-app-messaging-sdk-for-ios-sdk-apis-control-history-apis.html) to find out more.

#### Known issues
 
* **Lag of scroll upon first load**: When configured the scrolling configuration as "ScrollToBottom", there is a lag between showing the conversation screen and scrolling to the bottom.
