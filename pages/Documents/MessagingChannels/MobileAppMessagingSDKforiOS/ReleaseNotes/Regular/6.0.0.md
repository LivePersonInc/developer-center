#### New Features 
* We have unified the four messaging frameworks (LPInfra, LPMonitoring, LPMessagingSDK, and LPAMS) into 1 framework (LPMessagingSDK). This was done to alleviate confusion for our customers by providing a unified API for brands to query our APIs. Additionally the SDK size has decreased due to removal of duplicate and unnecessary code. We realize that our brands were unanimously using all four frameworks so we decided to lean into this flow by unifying the frameworks.  Our public APIs can now be found under the ‘LPMessaging’ class. For more information about integration of the new framework, please follow the guide(link for the quick start). 
* When the ‘getEngagement’ request returns with an error message, we will now flush the domain cache providing the ability for subsequent requests to obtain updated domains.  This functionality currently exists when connecting via the websocket, and now exists for this rest request as well.
* When the messaging window is moved to the background, the socket now remains open for only 5 seconds rather than 60 seconds.  This allows the iOS Mobile Messaging SDK to have parity with the Android SDK and will allow brands to experience a more unified experience across platforms.
* The  iOS Mobile Messaging SDK now uses os_log as its base logging object which allows brands to use the standard flow within Xcode to observe logs with the device console as well as sort logs by categories.  We will be providing more categories as we continue to make improvements to the SDK allowing our customers to focus on specific behaviors and flows within the SDK.
* In an effort to better support our customers by providing a more stable development experience we now support XCFrameworks.  Please see our guide to how to implement the XCFrameworks and note any changes you may need to make to your project’s CI/CD or build settings to take advantage of this new format.
* We now provide a soft “auto logout” feature whereby when a new user identifier is detected we will automatically logout the previous user information but not the brand information, and then allow the new user to attempt to login, as part of  this work, we made some improvements to the SDK Authentication flow to provide a better experience when handling, invalidating and requesting JWTs.
* We have made improvements to our current logging behavior.

##### Hyperlink Support in Messaging
Users using the enhanced Agent Workspace have the ability to share hyperlinks with consumers during a messaging conversation. Now, they can share it with consumers that are messaging over the Mobile SDK.
