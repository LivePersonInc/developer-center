##### New functionalities

##### Custom fonts

in order for consumers to enjoy the full brand experience while messaging in-app, brands are able to configure certified operating system fonts to appear in the messaging window. The fonts can be used across all elements, or only for the font within the message bubble.

The SDK also supports the use of a brand’s own customized fonts (although these are not certified).

Custom fonts are not supported for Native iOS properties such as:

* Activity mode — Overflow menu

* Popup messages
