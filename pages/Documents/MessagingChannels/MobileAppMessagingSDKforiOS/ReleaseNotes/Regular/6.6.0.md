Appointment List JSON schema is only supported on accounts using UMS version 4.2, please contact your LivePerson representative to validate your account qualifies for this feature.

#### Bugs fixed

- Fixed the issue with hyperlink not working on remote message.
- Fixed the issue with screen freezing after resolving conversation.
- Fixed the issue with Unread Message texts not being read by voice over.
- Fixed the issue with the "Loading" message not being read by voice over.
- Fixed the issue with the photo caption name having incorrect role of button.

#### Enhancements

- When the conversation comes from background to foreground, instead of requesting new authentication from IDP, SDK will check if it has a LP_JWT, then will try to connect and let the backend service do the expiration check.

If the token is not available, will trigger `LPMessagingSDKTokenExpired` or `LPMessagingSDKAuthenticationFailed` delegate accordingly.
