### Version 3.2.6
#### iOS Messaging SDK

**Version 3.2.6 includes fixes for the following bugs**:

1. In some cases, when consumers sent the app to the background and later returned to the conversation screen, the socket would not get connected and the consumer was not able to send or receive messages.

2. After killing the app, `getEngagement` (a Monitoring API method) would not return the details of the open conversation.
