In order to receive all incoming push notifications in a single function and handle them, add the following method. This method cooperates with two other API methods:

* This method calls the shouldShowPushNotification method. If the host app returns false, the SDK will not show anything to the UI.
* Otherwise, the SDK will ask the host app to provide a view as an in-app notification. If the host app doesnâ€™t implement this method, the SDK will use its own implementation.

```javascript
func application(application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [NSObject : AnyObject], fetchCompletionHandler completionHandler: (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> Void) {

		LPMessagingSDK.instance.handlePush(userInfo)

}
```
