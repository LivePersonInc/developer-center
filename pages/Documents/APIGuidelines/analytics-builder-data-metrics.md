Conversational Cloud uses a large amount of metrics to provide insightful and detailed reporting.

The Analytics Builder offers brands ready-made dashboards reflecting historic data drawn from their Conversational Cloud account activity. These dashboards allow brands to monitor and optimize contact center operations, increase conversions through Conversational Cloud Campaign Builder and enact data-driven decisions. All the data metrics available in the Analytics Builder, with their definition and location within the different dashboards can be found in our [Knowledge Center](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/data-reporting-reporting-metrics.html).
