The following considerations should be kept in mind when setting up Bots:

* What channel are you planning to deploy chats for?

	* Live Chat 
	* Messaging (including in-app, web messaging, sms or facebook messenger)
* Design the bot based on the selected use case:

	* What back end integrations are required?
	* Will you use structured content as part of the bot answers?
* How many languages will the bot be in?

	* Note that most AI systems are still young and focus on English.  If you are creating bots in multiple languages you should rely more on structured content.
	* Best practice is to create a separate bot per language.
* What will be the structure of your bot? 

	* Best practice is to have a bot focused on an individual, focused task
	* Have a few different bots per task or use case you want to implement
	* Each bot can be an agent user with a name and avatar
* Match the skills of your bots to the operational structure of the contact center operations

	* Associate bots to the appropriate skill and group
	* Best practice, have the word ‘bot’ in the skill you assign the bot to (e.g. address_chage_bot).  This will help with tracking and reporting
