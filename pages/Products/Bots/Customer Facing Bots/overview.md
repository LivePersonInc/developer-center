Bots can conduct several automatic tasks and communicate with your consumers to help take the load off your agents.

Any chatbot that you create or bring from a 3rd party can be fully integrated into LiveEngage.

Within LiveEngage, **bots are handled like your human agents**, providing you with the following benefits:

* Bots can perform all tasks that an agent can perform, and are measured in the same way
* Plug the bot directly into the LiveEngage conversation window and UI
* Seamlessly transition between bots and human agent in cases that require a personal touch
* Utilize LiveEngage data and reporting to run real time performance reports on your bots

Since bots are agents within LiveEngage, the integration requires the use of the Chat Agent API or the Messaging Agent SDK - both of which give you control over all the actions that agents can conduct in the system.
