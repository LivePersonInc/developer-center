Brands that use a Knowledge Base (KB) for agent answers or information can benefit from integrating this app directly into the LiveEngage Agent Workspace.  Agents will save time for themselves and lower the time it takes for them to reply through this easy access to the information and answers they need. 

Integration of a Knowledge Base (or any other tool or application) will display within the LiveEngage Agent Workspace as a widget which displays alongside the chat window. 

###  As you plan your widget, consider:

* Should it apply to all agents? Or particular skills?  LiveEngage allows you to customize a widget for each skill.  For example, if you have different lines of business or product lines, you can create a KB widget specific for agents working on that line. 

* The design of the widget will be controlled by you - ensure that you have a UX/UI design ready.  The design should fit into the LiveEngage workspace and also maintain the familiar KB look agents are accustomed to.

* Performance & load of your widget - each agent will open a connection to your widget.  If you have a high number of agents, consider load balancing to ensure your widget can handle the volume of anticipated connections. 

###  Available functionality:

As you control the development of your widget, you can also determine how much functionality you add.  

* Search only: display a widget with a direct search button to your KB system and allow for agents to search for and view results.

* Auto search: assist agents in the search by reading lines entered by consumers in the chat and automatically search the KB for those terms.  

* Search + push answer: allow the agents to click on an answer and push it directly into the chat window (eliminate the need to copy and paste).  Agents can have the ability to edit the answer before it is sent to the customer. 

### Prerequisties

In order for you to set up a KB integration widget, you need:

* A LiveEngage account and administrator login credentials

* A working KB system or database
