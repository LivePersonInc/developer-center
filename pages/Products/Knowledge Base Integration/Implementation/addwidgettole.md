Once your widget is ready, you need to add it to the LiveEngage Agent Workspace.  Follow these steps:

**Step 1** - [Login to your LiveEngage account)](https://authentication.liveperson.net/login.html){:target="_blank"}

_Note your user must be an administrator of the account._

**Step 2** - Click the **Night Vision Button** in the toolbar at the top of the screen.

  1. In the Integration widget, type in the name of the new widget. The widget icon is automatically generated and appears as the initials of the name you’ve chosen.

  2. Select the desired width of the new widget; single (the same width as the default widgets), double, triple, or quadruple, so your widget is compatible to the external webpage that you want to display.

  3. If you would like the widget to display only to agents with a specific skill(s), list them in the assigned skills box.

  4. Type the secured URL of the widget you developed.

**Step 5** - (optional) Set a login URL.  In case your KB requires agents to login, the widget will automatically login if they have the KB opened and logged into in a different tab in the browser.  By clicking on 'Advanced Settings for LivePerson Integration SDK’, you can set up a login page to direct agents to in case the widget doesn't’ automatically load.
