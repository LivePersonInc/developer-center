### Overview

The predefined content tool within LiveEngage is one which agents rely on to provide quick answers to repeating or long questions.  Agents are able to either search for predefined answers and push them directly into the conversations, or utilize hotkeys for quick entries.

Building and maintaining a current and comprehensive set of pre-defined content for your agents is crucial for accuracy and efficiency of agent responses.

**Using the [Predefined Content API](account-configuration-predefined-content-overview.html){:target="_blank"}, brands can automate the upkeep of these important messages.**
