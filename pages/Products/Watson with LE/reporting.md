**Meaningful Connection Score (MCS)**

LivePerson proprietary MCS scoring, based on Natural Language sentiment analysis is applied to Watson’s conversations in real time. This allows managers to decide to take action immediately for conversations with negative scores.

Agent managers can utilize MCS analytics to understand the root causes of performance issues and use these to optimize use cases or answers.
