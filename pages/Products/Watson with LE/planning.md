### Define a vision for your Watson implementation strategy

#### Set goals

Brands must first define their business-driven vision for adding Watson to their contact center operations, by defining their business goals. These may include:

* Decreasing operational costs

* Enhancing the customer experience and increasing customer satisfaction

* Increasing agent efficiency

* Reducing agent attrition and boosting agent satisfaction

#### Determine metrics

Defining your goals for Watson should also lead you to determine what metrics you will use to measure the impact and success of your bot operations, and thereby deciding what a successful Watson deployment would look like for your contact center. This can include CSAT, NPS and MCS target KPIs, as well as for transfer or containment rates, and agent retention.  

#### Map use cases

Watson is most effective when handling simple and automatic tasks; those that can make the biggest difference to the workload of your human agents once Watson takes them over. It’s important to take the time to map these use cases effectively to determine which tasks will be the most appropriate for Watson to handle. Consider questions such as:

* Evaluate the most common inquiries you handle from your consumers and determine if they are suitable for automation, or example, password reset, checking order status, account balance.

    * A transcript analysis of your chat and messaging conversations can help you to understand your top queries.

* Run a topic analysis on your conversations. LivePerson offers a specialized analytics service on natural language conversations - LivePerson Insights - that can be very useful in identifying topics for Watson’s actions.  

#### Assess customer feedback

LivePerson can help you to conduct user acceptance testing and validation to assess how consumers respond to journeys involving Watson, such as the following considerations:

* Are customers aware they are chatting with a bot? What is their reaction?

* How do they respond to terms such as virtual agent, Watson or bot?

* What is their response to being transferred to a human?

* Are your mapped use cases working? Are consumers behaving as you would expect?

Committing to Watson as an agent in your enterprise contact center should occur in stages over a long term project. It is recommended to start small in order to check performance and business impact and scale slowly.
