The LiveEngage messaging platform enables brands to provide a continuous connection with consumers, creating the personalized, convenient level of service people expect today - straight to their mobile devices. The LiveEngage SMS solution provides brands with multiple entry points for their consumers, whether it’s IVR Deflection to SMS or Google AdWords Click-to-Message.

The key to the best SMS experience for both brand and consumer is choosing the best entry point(s). Where is your consumer traffic? Are your consumers active in your app? Are your consumers busy calling a 1800 number? By choosing the best entry point(s) brands can ensure that SMS engagement will be an effective channel for meaningfully engaging with consumers.

This document is a comprehensive guide for all the LiveEngage SMS entry points. If you are interested in configuring a specific entry point, skip ahead to that specific section. If you are just interested in reading about an entry point, explore the document and feel free to jump between sections.
