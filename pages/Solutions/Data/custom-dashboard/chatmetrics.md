When creating dashboards consisting of Live Chat data, utilize the **[LiveEngage Real time Operational API](data-operational-realtime-overview.html)** . This API offers a wide array of data points reflecting your LivePerson operations and is available to you in real time.

* Select the metrics and filters that will meet the goals you defined for your dashboard.

* Consider what level would you display the data in your dashboard? By skill, account, agent?

* Below are metrics recommendations for you based on most common use:

### Queue Health

This set of metrics displays the real time information about the number of customers that are waiting for chat or have abandoned.  This information is useful both for the manager dashboard as well as agent dashboard.  Top metrics used from queue health include:

* Number visitors entered queue

* Number abandoned

* Queue size

### Engagement Activity

This set of metrics enables the understanding of the overall number of chats that agents are participating in.  This information can be viewed by agent or can be aggregated to the skill level.

The Engagement Activity metrics are used to monitor agent performance by managers. Information such as how many chats agents are taking and how long it takes to resolve a chat.  
These metrics are also helpful for executive dashboards in order to compare agents, groups, or managers.  This information can be used to alert executives when spikes occur as they may alert to an issue.

Top metrics from Engagement Activity include:

* Total interactive chats

* Total non interactive chats

* Time to handle

### Agent Activity

Metrics in this section will cover the information that agement managers need in order to view and monitor the activities conducted by agents throughout the shift.  In your dashboard, you can drill down per agent and display their individual breaks, loads and activities.

### Histogram

The metrics presented in the histogram paint an overall picture of the level of service your contact center is providing at any given moment.  This information is used for executive or manager dashboards.  Common metrics include: 

* Distribution of accumulated trend

* Time to respond and answer (for example if you need to measure 50% of the calls that are answered within the first 10 seconds)
