### Overview

Consumers prefer to message rather than call brands.  However, in some cases, a higher touch interaction such as a video call can help to make the conversation more effective.

### Benefits of using video chat:

* **Solve issues, the first time around**: video gives agents the best tools for achieving first contact resolution and reducing wait time and average hold time. 

* **Build relationships with your customers**: video lets agents meaningfully connect with consumers they are already messaging with, fostering a more personal connection.

* **Flexibility in meeting consumer needs**: consumers expect to have the flexibility to do all types of communication in one place over chat. Now brands can meet their customer’s expectations by providing them with chat and video all within one place, achieving the complete digital experience.

### Use cases:

* Solve intricate tech support issues or inquiries that would be hard to describe without visuals. For example, guide a customer on resetting the wires on a modem. 

* Provide your VIP customers with concierge, premium treatment. 
Video provides tailored solutions and service for consumers, with their personal choices kept on priority.  

* Replace in-person meetings such as consultations or long application process with real-time assistance and in-store experience.

* Identify consumers when verification is needed on personal and secure issues.
