<div class="important">Please see our <a href="https://knowledge.liveperson.com/agent-manager-workspace-workspace-configuration-salesforce-integration-guide.html">Knowledge Center</a> for more updated information on our Salesforce integration and how to use it.</div>

This integration will allow you to see and create your Salesforce Contact, Lead, Account and Opportunity record data right from within LiveEngage. It will also allow you to view your LiveEngage transcripts from within Salesforce. Brands that use LiveEngage for sales and support can offer a more personalized, informed experience with access to Salesforce by giving agents a full overview of the account, including previous or existing cases, opportunities and even potential leads.

Brands that use LiveEngage for sales and support can offer a more personalized, informed experience with access to Salesforce, by giving agents a full overview of the account, including previous or existing cases, opportunities and even potential leads. Through the LiveEngage Salesforce integration, agents can utilize the workspace to conduct all conversations with customers, and get instant access to pertinent information without having to open a separate browser window to manually check the Salesforce record. Agents can also search through records using the field from pre-chat surveys and/or through the widget.

Furthermore, agents have the ability to easily create records in Salesforce as part of the conversation (leads, opportunities, accounts, cases) and store the conversation transcript and additional info in the CRM after the engagement.
